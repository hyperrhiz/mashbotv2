A LOVER'S DISCOURSE        The necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover's discourse is today of an extreme solitude. This discourse is spoken, perhaps, by thousands of subjects (who knows?), but warranted by no one; it is completely forsaken by the surrounding languages: ignored, disparaged, or derided by them, severed not only from authority but also from the mechanisms of authority (sciences, techniques, arts). Once a discourse is thus driven by its own momentum into the backwater of the "unreal," exiled from all gregarity, it has no recourse but to become the site, however exiguous, of an affirmation. That affirmation is, in short, the subject of the book which begins here...    How this book is       constructed           Everything follows from this principle: that the lover is not to be reduced to a simple symptomal subject, but rather that we hear in his voice what is "unreal," i.e., intractable. Whence the choice of a "dramatic" method which renounces examples and rests on the single action of a primary language (no metalanguage). The description of the lover's discourse has been replaced by its simulation, and to that discourse has been restored its fundamental person, the I, in order to stage an utterance, not an analysis. What is proposed, then, is a portrait - but not a psychological portrait; instead, a structural once which offers the reader a discursive site: the site of someone speaking within himself, amorously, confronting the other (the loved object), who does not speak.         1       Figures           Dis-cursus - originally the action of running here and there, comings and goings, measures taken, "plots and plans": the lover, in fact, cannot keep his mind from racing, taking new measures and plotting against himself. His discourse exists only in outbursts of language, which occur at the whim of trivial, of aleatory circumstances.    These fragments of discourse can be called figures. The word is to be understood, not in its rhetorical sense, but rather in its gymnastic or choreographic acceptation; in short, in the Greek meaning: is not the "schema," but, in a much livelier way, the body's gesture caught in action and not contemplated in repose: the body of athletes, orators, statues: what in the straining body can be immobilized. S$0o it is with the lover at grips with his figures: he struggles in a kind of lunatic sport, he spends himself, like an athlete; he "phrases," like an orator; he is caught, stuffed into a role, like a statue. The figure is the lover at work.       Figures take shape insofar as we can recognize, in passing discourse, something that has been read, heard, felt. The figure is outlined (like a sign) and memorable (like an image or a tale). A figure is established if at least someone can say: "That's so true! I recognize that scene of language." For certain operations of their art, linguists make use of a vague entity which they call linguistic feeling; in order to constitute figures, we require neither more nor less than this guide: amorous feeling.    Ultimately it is unimportant whether the text's dispersion is rich here and poor there; there are nodes, blanks, many figures break off short; some, being hypostases of the whole of the lover's discourse, have just the rarity - the poverty - of essences: What is to be said of Languor, of the Image, of the Love Letter, since it is the whole of the lover's discourse which is woven of languorous desire, of the image-repertoire, of declarations? But he who utters this discourse and shapes its episodes does not know that a book is to be made of them; he does not yet know that as a good cultural subject he should neither repeat nor contradict himself, nor take the whole for the part; all he knows is that what passes through his mind at a certain moment is marked, like the printout of a code (in other times, this would have been the code of courtly love, or the Carte du Tendre).    Each of us can fill in this code according to his own history; rich or poor, the figure must be there, the site (the compartment) must be reserved for it. It is as if there were an amorous Topic, whose figure was a site (topos). Now the property of a Topic is to be somewhat empty: a Topic is statutorily half coded, half projective (or projective because coded). What we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: "To the United Readers and Lovers.")       What reads as the heading of each figure is not its       definition but its argument. Argumentum: "exposition, account, summary, plot outline, invented narrative"; I       should add: instrument of distancing, signboard a la       Brecht. This argument does not refer to the amorous subject and what he is (no one external to this subject, no       discourse on love), but to what he says. If there is such a       figure as " Anxiety," it is because the subject sometimes       exclaims (without any concern for the clinical sense of the       word): "I am having an anxiety attack! " Anxiety,       Anguish... "Angoscia!" Callas sings somewhere. The          figure is a kind of opera aria; just as this aria is identified,          memorized, and manipulated through its incipit ("When I          am laid," "Pleurez, mes yeux," "Lucevan le stelle,"       "Piangero la mia sorte"), so the figure takes its departure    from a turn of phrase, a kind of verse, refrain, or cantillation which articulates it in the darkness.           It is said that words alone have specific uses, not sentences; but underneath each figure lies a sentence, frequently an unknown (unconscious? ) one, which has its       use in the signifying economy of the amorous subject. This matrix-sentence (here merely postulated) is not a "saturated" one, not a completed message. Its active principle is not what it says but what it articulates: by and large, it is only a "syntactical aria," a "mode of construction." For instance, if the subject awaits the loved object at a rendezvous, a sentence-aria keeps running through his head: "All the same, it's not fair..."; "he/she could have..."; "he/she knows perfectly well...": knows what? It doesn't matter, the figure "Waiting" is already formed. Such sentences are matrices of figures precisely because they remain suspended: they utter the affect, then break off, their role is filled. The words are never crazed (at most perverse), but the syntax is: is it not on the level of the sentence that the subject seeks his place - and fails to find it - or finds a false place imposed upon him by language? Underneath the figure, there is something of the "verbal hallucination" (Freud, Lacan): a mutilated sentence which is generally limited to its syntactical portion ("Even though you are..." "If you were still..."). Whence the emotion of every figure: even the mildest bears within it the terror of a suspense: in it, I hear the tempestuous, Neptunian quos ego   ...    2       Order        Throughout any love life, figures occur to the lover without any order, for on each occasion they depend on an (internal or external) accident. Confronting each of these incidents (what "befalls" him), the amorous subject draws on the reservoir (the thesaurus?) of figures, depending on the needs, the injunctions, or the pleasures of his image-repertoire. Each figure explodes, vibrates in and of itself like a sound severed from any tune - or is repeated to satiety, like the motif of a hovering music. No logic links the figures, determines their contiguity: the figures are non-syntagmatic, non-narrative; they are Erinyes; they stir, collide, subside, return, vanish with no more order than the flight of mosquitoes. Amorous dis-cursus is not dialectical; it turns like a perpetual calendar, an encyclopedia of affective culture (there is something of Bouvard and Pecuchet in the lover).    In linguistic terms, once might say that the figures are distributional but not integrative; they always remain on the same level: the lover speaks in bundles of sentences but does not integrate these sentences on a higher level, into a work; his is a horizontal discourse: no transcendence, no deliverance, no novel (though a great deal of the fictive). Every amorous episode can be, of course, endowed with a meaning: it is generated, develops, and dies; it follows a path which it is always possible to interpret according to a causality or a finality - even, if need be, which can be moralized ("I was out of my mind, I'm over it now" "Love is a trap which must be avoided from now on" etc.): this is the love story, subjugated to the great narrative Other, to that general opinion which disparages any excessive force and wants the subject himself to reduce the great imaginary current, the orderless, endless stream which is passing through him, to a painful, morbid crisis of which he must be cured, which he must "get over" ("It develops, grows, causes suffering, and passes away" in the fashion of some Hippocratic disease): the love story (the "episode," the "adventure") is the tribute the lover must pay to the world in order to be reconciled with it.    Very different is the discourse, the soliloquy, the aside       which accompanies this story (and this history), without    ever knowing it. It is the very principle of this discourse       (and of the text which represents it) that its figures cannot       be classified: organized, hierarchized, arranged with a view       to an end (a settlement): there are no first figures, no last       figures. To let it be understood that there was no question          here of a love story (or of the history of a love), to       discourage the temptation of meaning, it was necessary to    choose an absolutely insignificant    order. Hence we have    subjugated the series of figures (inevitable as any series is,       since the book is by its status obliged to progress) to a       pair of arbitrary factors: that of nomination and that of       the alphabet. Each of these arbitrary factors is nonetheless    tempered: one by semantic necessity (among all the nouns       in the dictionary, a figure can receive only two or three),       the other by the age-old convention which decides the          order of our alphabet. Hence we have avoided the wiles of       pure chance, which might indeed have produced logical       sequences; for we must not, one mathematician tells us,          "underestimate the power of chance to engender mon   sters"; the monster, in this case, would have been, emerging from a certain order of the figures, a "philosophy of          love" where we must look for no more than its affirmation.       3       References        In order to compose this amorous subject, pieces of       various origin have been "put together." Some come    from an ordinary reading, that of Goethe's Werther.       Some come from insistent readings (Plato's Symposium,       Zen, psychoanalysis, certain Mystics, Nietzsche, German       lieder). Some come from occasional readings.       Some come from conversations with friends. And there are some    which come from my own life.        What comes from books and from friends occasionally       appears in the margin of the text, in the form of names          (for the books) and initials (for the friends). The references supplied in this fashion are not authoritative but       amical; I am not invoking guarantees, merely recalling, by       a kind of salute given in passing, what has seduced, con   vinced, or what has momentarily given the delight of understanding (of being understood?). Therefore, these    reminders of reading, of listening, have been left in the       frequently uncertain, incompleted state suitable to a discourse whose occasion is indeed the memory of the sites       (books, encounters) where such and such a thing has been       read, spoken, heard. For if the author here lends his "culture" to the amorous subject, in exchange the amorous       subject affords him the innocence of his image-repertoire,          indifferent to the proprieties of knowledge.    So it is a lover who speaks       and who says:           "1 am engulfed   , I     succumb..."        s'abimer / to be engulfed          Outburst of annihilation which affects the amorous       subject in despair or fulfillment.        1.       Either woe or well-being, sometimes I have a craving to be engulfed. This morning (in the country), the       weather is mild, overcast. I am suffering (from some incident). The notion of suicide occurs to me, pure of any       resentment (not blackmailing anyone); an insipid notion;       it alters nothing ("breaks" nothing), matches the color    (the silence, the desolation) of this morning.       Another day, in the rain, we're waiting for the boat at the lake; from happiness, this time, the same outburst of annihilation sweeps through me. This is how it happens sometimes, misery or joy engulfs me, without any particular tumult ensuing:: nor any pathos: I am dissolved, not dismembered; I fall, I flow, I melt. Such thoughts - grazed, touched, tested (the way you test the water with your foot) - can recur. Nothing solemn about them. This is exactly what gentleness is.        2. The crisis of engulfment can come from a wound,       but also from a fusion: we die together from loving each       other: an open death, by dilution into the ether, a closed       death of the shared grave.           Engulfment is a moment of hypnosis. A suggestion func   tions, which commands me to swoon without killing myself. Whence, perhaps, the gentleness of the abyss: I have       no responsibility here, the act (of dying) is not up to me:       I entrust myself, I transmit myself ( to whom? to God, to          Nature, to everything, except to the other).    3.       Therefore, on those occasions when I am engulfed,       it is because there is no longer any place for me anywhere,       not even in death. The image of the other - to which I was    glued, on which I lived - no longer exists; sometimes this       is a (futile) catastrophe which seems to remove the image       forever, sometimes it is an excessive happiness which en   ables me to unite with the image; in any case, severed or       united, dissolved or discrete, I am nowhere gathered together; opposite, neither you nor me, nor death, nor anything else to talk to.           (Strangely, it is in the extreme action of the amorous       Image-repertoire - annihilation as a consequence of driving out the image or of being identified with it - that there    occurs a fall of this Image-repertoire: for the brief interval       of a vacillation, I lose my structure as a lover: this is a       factitious mourning, without work to do: something like a          non-site.)        4. In love with death? An exaggeration to say, with       Keats, half in love with easeful death: death liberated       from dying. Then I have this fantasy: a gentle hemorrhage    which flows from no specific point in my body, an almost       immediate consumption, calculated so that I might have    the time to abate my suffering without yet having died.       Fleetingly I establish myself within a false conception of       death (false the way a key is "falsified" by warping): I    conceive of death beside me: I conceive of it according to    an unthought logic, I drift outside of the fatal couple    which links life and death by opposing them to each other.          5.       Is the abyss no more than an expedient annihilation? It would not be difficult for me to read the abyss,    not as a repose, but as an emotion. I mask my mourning    by an evasion; I dilute myself, I swoon in order to escape    that density, that clogging which makes me into a responsible subject: I come out: it is ecstasy.           Rue du Cherche-Midi, after a difficult evening, X was    explaining very carefully, his voice exact, his sentences    well-formed, far from anything inexpressible, that sometimes he longed to swoon; he regretted never being able to       disappear at will.        His words were saying that he meant then to succumb to    his weakness, not to resist the wounds the world inflicted       upon him; but at the same time he was substituting for this    failing strength another strength, another affirmation: I    assume toward and against everything a denial of courage,    hence a denial of morality: that is what X's voice was    saying.       The Absent One         absence /    absence           Any episode of language which stages the absence       of the loved object - whatever its cause and its          duration - and which tends to transform this          absence into an ordeal of abandonment.       1. Many lieder, songs, and melodies about the beloved's absence. And yet this classic figure is not to be found in Werther. The reason is simple: here the loved object (Charlotte) does not move; it is the amorous subject (Werther) who, at a certain moment, departs. Now, absence can exist only as a consequence of the other: it is the other who leaves, it is I who remain. The other is in a condition of perpetual departure, of journeying; the other is, by vocation, migrant, fugitive; I - I who love, by converse vocation, am sedentary, motionless, at hand, in expectation, nailed to the spot, in suspense - like a package in some forgotten corner of a railway station. Amorous absence functions in a single direction, expressed by the one who stays, never by the one who leaves: an always present I is constituted only by confrontation with an always absent you. To speak this absence is from the start to propose that the subject's place and the other's place cannot permute; it is to say: "I am loved less than I love."    2.       Historically, the discourse of absence is carried on       by the Woman: Woman is sedentary, Man hunts, journeys; Woman is faithful (she waits), man is fickle (he    sails away, he cruises). It is Woman who gives shape to       absence, elaborates its fiction, for she has time to do so;       she weaves and she sings; the Spinning Songs express both       immobility (by the hum of the Wheel) and absence (far       away, rhythms of travel, sea surges, cavalcades). It follows that in any man who utters the other's absence some   thing feminine is declared: this man who waits and who       suffers from his waiting is miraculously feminized. A man       is not feminized because he is inverted but because he is in       love. (Myth and utopia: the origins have belonged, the       future will belong to the subjects in whom there is some   thing feminine.)           3. Sometimes I have no difficulty enduring absence. Then I am "normal": I fall in with the way "everyone" endures the departure of a "beloved person"; I diligently obey the training by which I was very early accustomed to be separated from my mother - which nonetheless remained, at its source, a matter of suffering (not to say hysteria). I behave as a well-weaned subject; I can feed myself, meanwhile, on other things besides the maternal breast.           This endured absence is nothing more or less than forgetfulness. I am, intermittently, unfaithful. This is the condi   tion of my survival; for if I did not forget, I should die.          The lover who doesn't forget sometimes dies of excess,    exhaustion, and tension of memory (like Werther).    (As a child, I didn't forget: interminable days, abandoned          days, when the Mother was working far away; I would go,    evenings, to wait for her at the bus stop, Sevres-Babylone; the buses would pass one after the other, she       wasn't in any of them.)        4.    I  waken out of this forgetfulness very quickly. In great haste, I reconstitute a memory, a confusion. A (classic) word comes from the body, which expresses the emotion of absence: to sigh: "to sigh for the bodily presence": the two halves of the androgyne sigh for each other, as if each breath, being incomplete, sought to mingle with the other: the image of the embrace, in that it melts the two images into a single one: in amorous absence, I am, sadly, an unglued image that dries, yellows, shrivels.        (But isn't desire always the same, whether the object is       present or absent? Isn't the object always absent? - This          isn't the same languor: there are two words: Pothos, de   sire for the absent being, and Himeros, the more burning    desire for the present being.)        5.    Endlessly I sustain the discourse of the beloved's absence; actually a preposterous situation; the other is absent as referent, present as allocultory. This singular distortion generates a kind of insupportable present; I am wedged between two tenses, that of the reference and that of the allocution: you have gone (which I lament), you are here (since I am addressing you). Whereupon I know what the present, that difficult tense, is: a pure portion of anxiety. Absence persists - I must endure it. Hence I will manipulate it: transform the distortion of time into oscillation, produce rhythm, make an entrance onto the stage of language (language is born of absence: the child has made himself a doll out of a spool, throws it away and picks it up again, miming the mother's departure and return: a paradigm is created). Absence becomes an active practice, a business (which keeps me from doing anything else); there is a creation of a fiction which has many roles (doubts, reproaches, desires, melancholies). This staging of language postpones the other's death: a very short interval, we are told, separates the time during which the child still believes his mother to be absent and the time during which he believes her to be already dead. To manipulate absence is to extend this interval, to delay as long as possible the moment when the other might topple sharply from absence into death.    6.       Frustration would have Presence as its figure (I see the other every day, yet I am not satisfied thereby: the object is actually there yet continues, in terms of my image-repertoire, to be absent for me). Whereas castration has Intermittence as its figure (I agree to leave the other for a while, "without tears," I assume the grief of the relation, I am able to forget). Absence is the figure of privation; simultaneously, I desire and I need. Desire is squashed against need: that is the obsessive phenomenon of all amorous sentiment.       ("Desire is present, ardent, eternal: but God is higher       still, and the raised arms of Desire never attain to the          adored plenitude." The discourse of Absence is a text with       two ideograms: there are the raised arms of Desire, and       there are the wide-open arms of Need. I oscillate, I vacillate between the phallic image of the raised arms, and the          babyish image of the wide-open arms.)        7.    I take a seat, alone, in a cafe; people come over and speak to me; I feel that I am sought after, surrounded, flattered. But the other is absent; I invoke the other inwardly to keep me on the brink of this mundane complacency, a temptation. I appeal to the other's "truth" (the truth of which the other gives me the sensation) against the hysteria of seduction into which I feel myself slipping. I make the other's absence responsible for my worldliness: I invoke the other's protection, the other's return: let the other appear, take me away, like a mother who comes looking for her child, from this worldly brilliance, from this social infatuation, let the other restore to me "the religious intimacy, the gravity" of the lovers world. (X once told me that love had protected him against worldliness: coteries, ambitions, advancements, interferences, alliances, secessions, roles, powers: love had made him into a social catastrophe, to his delight.)     8. A Buddhist Koan says: "The master    holds the       disciple's head underwater for a long, long time; gradually          the bubbles become fewer; at the last moment, the master       pulls the disciple out and revives him: when you have    you have       craved truth as you crave air, then you will know    what       truth is."       The absence of the other holds my head underwater;       gradually I drown, my air supply gives out: it is by this    asphyxia that I reconstitute my "truth" and that I prepare          what in love is Intractable.       " Adorable!"         adorable / adorable       Not managing to name the specialty of his desire          for the loved being, the amorous subject falls back    on this rather stupid word: adorable!       1. "One lovely September day, I went out to do some    errands. Paris was adorable that morning...," etc.    A host of perceptions suddenly come together to form a       suddenly    dazzling impression (to dazzle is ultimately to prevent    sight, to prevent speech): the weather, the season, the    light, the boulevard, the Parisians out walking, shopping,    all held within what already has its vocation as memory: a    scene, in short, the hieroglyph of kindliness (as Greuze    might have painted it), the good humor of desire. All    Paris is within my grasp, without my wanting to grasp it:    neither languor nor lust. I forget all the reality in Paris       which exceeds its charm: history, labor, money, merchandise - all the harshness of big cities; here I see only    the object of an aesthetically restrained desire. From the    top of Pere Lachaise, Rastignac hurled his challenge to the    city: Between the two of us now; I say to Paris: Adorable!       After an impression of the night before, I wake up softened by a happy thought: "X was adorable last night."    thought    This is the memory of... what? Of what the Greeks    called charis: "the sparkle of the eyes, the body's luminous        beauty, the radiance of the desirable being"; and I may         even add, just as in the ancient charis, the notion - the       hope - that the loved object will bestow itself upon my       desire.        2. By a singular logic, the amorous subject perceives the other as a Whole (in the fashion of Paris on an autumn afternoon), and, at the same time, this Whole seems to him to involve a remainder, which he cannot express. It is the other as a whole who produces in him an aesthetic vision: he praises the other for being perfect, he glorifies himself for having chosen this perfect other; he imagines that the other wants to be loved, as he himself would want to be loved, not for one or another of his qualities, but for everything, and this everything he bestows upon the other in the form of a blank word, for the Whole cannot be inventoried without being diminished: in Adorable! there is no residual quality, but only the everything of affect. Yet, at the same time that adorable says everything, it also says what is lacking in everything; it seeks to designate that site of the other to which my desire clings in a special way, but this site cannot be designated; about it I shall never know anything; my language will always fumble, stammer in order to attempt to express it, but I can never produce anything but a blank word, an empty vocable, which is the zero degree of all the sites where my very special desire for this particular other (and for no other) will form.     3.    I encounter millions of bodies in my life; of these    millions, I may desire some hundreds; but of these hundreds, I love only one. The other with whom I am in love    designates for me the specialty of my desire.        This choice, so rigorous that it retains only the Unique, constitutes, it is said, the difference between the analytical transference and the amorous transference; one is universal, the other specific. It has taken many accidents, many surprising coincidences (and perhaps many efforts), for me to find the Image which, out of a thousand, suits my desire. Herein a great enigma, to which I shall never possess the key: Why is it that I desire So-and-so? Why is it that I desire So-and-so lastingly, longingly? Is it the whole of So-and-so I desire (a silhouette, a shape, a mood)? And, in that case, what is it in this loved body which has the vocation of a fetish for me? What perhaps incredibly tenuous portion - what accident? The way a nail is cut, a tooth broken slightly aslant, a lock of hair, a way of spreading the fingers while talking, while smoking? About all these folds of the body, I want to say that they are adorable. Adorable means: this is my desire, insofar as it is unique: "That's it! That's it exactly (which I love)!" Yet the more I experience the specialty of my desire, the less I can give it a name; to the precision of the target corresponds a wavering of the name; what is characteristic of desire, proper to desire, can produce only an impropriety of the utterance. Of this failure of language, there remains only one trace: the word "adorable" (the right translation of "adorable" would be the Latin ipse: it is the self, himself, herself, in person).    4. Adorable is the futile vestige of a fatigue - the    fatigue       of language itself. From word to word, I struggle    to put    "into other words" the ipseity of my Image, to          express improperly the propriety of my desire: a journey       a       at whose end my final philosophy can only be to recognize       - and to practice - tautology. The adorable is what is    adorable. Or again: I adore you because you are adorable,       I love you because I love you. What thereby closes off the       lover's language is the very thing which has instituted it:          fascination. For to describe fascination can never, in the    last analysis, exceed this utterance: "I am fascinated."    Having attained the end of language, where it can merely       repeat its last word like a scratched record, I intoxicate       myself upon its affirmation: is not tautology that       preposterous state in which are to be found, all values    being confounded, the glorious end of the logical opera   tion, the obscenity of stupidity, and the explosion of the       Nietzschean yes?          The Intractable         affirmation / affirmation        Against and in spite of everything, the subject       affirms love as value.          1.    Despite the difficulties of my story, despite discomforts, doubts, despairs, despite impulses to be done with it, I unceasingly affirm love, within myself, as a value. Though I listen to all the arguments which the most divergent systems employ to demystify, to limit, to erase, in short to depreciate love, I persist: "I know, I know, but all the same ...". I refer the devaluations of love to a kind of obscurantist ethic, to a let's-pretend realism, against which I erect the realism of value: I counter whatever "doesn't work" in love with the affirmation of what is worthwhile. This stubbornness is love's protest: for all the wealth of "good reasons" for loving differently, loving better, loving without being in love, etc., a stubborn voice is raised which lasts a little longer: the voice of the Intractable lover.       The world subjects every enterprise to an alternative; that    of success or failure, of victory or defeat. I protest by    another logic: I am simultaneously and contradictorily    happy and wretched; "to succeed" or "to fail" have for    me only contingent, provisional meanings (which doesn't    keep my sufferings and my desires from being violent);       what inspires me, secretly and stubbornly, is not a tactic: I    accept and I affirm, beyond truth and falsehood, beyond    success and failure: I have withdrawn from all finality, I    live according to chance (as is evidenced by the fact that    the figures of my discourse occur to me like so many dice    casts). Flouted in my enterprise (as it happens), I emerge    from it neither victor nor vanquished: I am tragic.    (Someone tells me: this kind of love is not viable. But       how can you evaluate    viability? Why is the viable a Good Thing? Why is it better to last than to    burn?)        2. This morning, I must get off an "important" letter right away - one on which the success of a certain undertaking depends; but instead I write a love letter - which I do not send. I gladly abandon dreary tasks, rational scruples, reactive undertakings imposed by the world, for the sake of a useless task deriving from a dazzling Duty: the lover's Duty. I perform, discreetly, lunatic chores; I am the sole witness of my lunacy. What love lays bare in me is energy. Everything I do has a meaning (hence I can live, without whining), but this meaning is an ineffable finality: it is merely the meaning of my strength. The painful, guilty, melancholy inflections, the whole reactive side of my everyday life is reversed. Werther praises his own tension, which he affirms, in contrast to Albert's platitudes. Born of literature, able to speak only with the help of its worn codes, yet I am alone with my strength, doomed to my own philosophy.    3.    In the Christian West, until today, all strength       passes through the Interpreter, as a type (in Nietzschean    terms, the Judaic High Priest). But the strength of love       cannot be shifted, be put into the hands of an Interpreter;    it remains here, on the level of language, enchanted, intractable. Here the type is not the Priest, it is the Lover.           4.    Love has two affirmations. First of all, when the    lover encounters the other, there is an immediate affirmation (psychologically: dazzlement, enthusiasm, exaltation,       mad projection of a fulfilled future: I am devoured by    desire, the impulse to be happy): I say yes to everything    (blinding myself). There foIlows a long tunnel: my first       yes is riddled by doubts, love's value is ceaselessly threatened by depreciation: this is the moment of melancholy    passion, the rising of resentment and of oblation. Yet I    can emerge from this tunnel; I can "surmount," without    liquidating; what I have affirmed a first time, I can once    again affirm, without repeating it, for then what I affirm       is the affirmation, not its contingency: I affirm the first    encounter in its difference, I desire its return, not its    repetition. I say to the other (old or new): Let us begin    again.          The Tip of the Nose      alteration / alteration           Abrupt production. within the amorous field, of a    c   ounter-image of the loved object. According to    minor incidents or tenuous features, the subject       suddenly sees the good Image alter and capsize.       1.    Ruysbroeck has been buried for five years; he is exhumed; his body is intact and pure (of course - otherwise, there would be no story); but "there was only the tip of the nose which bore a faint but certain trace of corruption." In the other's perfect and "embalmed" figure (for that is the degree to which it fascinates me) I perceive suddenly a speck of corruption. This speck is a tiny one: a gesture, a word, an object, a garment, something unexpected which appears (which dawns) from a region I had never even suspected, and suddenly attaches the loved object to a commonplace world. Could the other be vulgar, whose elegance and originality I had so religiously hymned? Here is a gesture by which is revealed a being of another race. I am flabbergasted: I hear a counter-rhythm: something like a syncope in the lovely phrase of the loved being, the noise of a rip in the smooth envelope of the       Image.           (Like the Jesuit Kircher's hen, released from hypnosis by       a light tap, I am temporarily de-fascinated, not without       pain.)       2. It is as if the alteration of the Image occurs when I am ashamed for the other (the fear of this shame, according to Phaedrus, kept the Greek lovers in the ways of the Good, each obliged to care for his own image in the other's eyes). Now, shame comes from subjection: the other, because of a trivial incident which only my perspicacity or my madness apprehend, suddenly appears - is revealed, is exposed, in the photographic sense of the term - as subjected to an instance which is itself of a servile order: I suddenly see the other (a question of vision) busily or frenziedly or just insistently abiding by, respecting, yielding to worldly rites by which some sort of recognition is hoped for. For the bad Image is not a wicked image; it is a paltry image: it shows me the other caught up in the platitude of the social world-commonplace. (Or again: the other alters if he or she sides with the banalities the world professes in order to depreciate love: the other becomes gregarious.)        3.       Once, speaking to me of ourselves, the other said:    "a relation of quality"; this phrase was repugnant to me:    it came suddenly from outside, flattening the specialty of    the rapport by a conformist formula.        Quite frequently, it is by language that the other is altered; the other speaks a different word, and I hear rumbling menacingly a whole other world, which is the world of the other. When Albertine drops the trivial phrase "get her pot broken," the Proustian narrator is horrified, for it is the dreaded ghetto of female homosexuality, of crude cruising, which is suddenly revealed thereby: a whole scene through the keyhole of language. The word is of a       tenuous chemical substance which performs the most violent alterations: the other, long maintained in the cocoon       of my own discourse, suggests, by a word escaping un   checked from his or her lips, the languages which can be    borrowed, and which consequently others have lent.       4. Sometimes, too, the other appears to me as subjected to a desire. But what then constitutes the corruption is not in my eyes a desire which is formed, named, proposed, aimed - in which case I would be, more simply, jealous (which derives from another tonality); it is only a nascent desire, a whiff of desire which I detect in the other, without the other's being really conscious of it: I see the other, in conversation, stir, multiply, perform to excess, assume a position of demand with regard to a third party, as though hung upon that third party in order to seduce him. Observe any such encounter carefully: you will see this subject (discreetly, mundanely) infatuated by this other, driven to establish with this other a warmer, more demanding, more flattering relation: I surprise the other, so to speak, in the act of self-inflation. I perceive an infatuation of being, which is not so far from what Sade would have called an effervescence of countenance ("I saw the sperm shooting from his eyes"); and, should the solicited partner respond in the same manner, the scene becomes ridiculous: I have the vision of two peacocks spreading their tails, each in front of the other. The image is corrupted, because the person I suddenly see is then    another (and no longer the other), a stranger (and    mad?)   .    (For example, in the train from Biskra, Gide, in complicity with the three Algerian schoolboys, "gasping, panting" before his wife, who was pretending to read, looked    like "a criminal or a madman." Is not any other desire but    mine       insane?)       5.       The lover's discourse is usually a smooth envelope    which encases the Image, a very gentle glove around the       gentle    loved being. It is a devout, orthodox discourse. When the    Image alters, the envelope of devotion rips apart; a shock    capsizes my own language. Wounded by a remark he overhears, Werther suddenly sees Charlotte in the guise of a    gossip, he includes her within the group of her companions with whom she is chattering (she is no longer the    other, but one among others), and then says disdainfully:       "my good little women" (meine Weibchen). A blasphemy    abruptly rises to the subject's lips and disrespectfully explodes the lover's benediction; he is possessed by a demon    who speaks through his mouth, out of which emerge, as in    the fairy tales, no longer flowers, but toads. Horrible ebb       of the Image. (The horror of spoiling is even stronger than    the anxiety of losing.)        Agony         angoisse / anxiety           The amorous subject according to one          contingency or another, feels swept away by the       fear of a danger, an injury, an abandonment, a       revulsion - a sentiment he expresses under the          name of anxiety.        1. Tonight I came back to the hotel alone; the other    has decided to return later on. The anxieties are already    here, like the poison already prepared (jealousy, abandonment, restlessness); they merely wait for a little time to pass in order to be able to declare themselves with some propriety. I pick up a book and take a sleeping pill, "calmly." The silence of this huge hotel is echoing, indifferent, idiotic (faint murmur of draining bathtubs); the furniture and the lamps are stupid; nothing friendlly that might warm ("I'm cold, let's go back to Paris"). Anxiety mounts; I observe its progress, like Socrates chatting (as I am reading) and feeling the cold of the hemlock rising in his body; I hear it identify itself moving up, like an inexorable figure, against the background of the things that are here.     (And if, so that something might happen I were to make       a vow?)           2.       The psychotic lives in the terror of breakdown       (against which Ihe various psychoses are merely defenses). But "the clinical fear of breakdown is the fear of       a breakdown which has already been experienced (primi   tive agony)... and there are moments when a patient       needs to be told that the breakdown, fear of which is       wrecking his life, has already occurred." Similarly, it       seems, for the lover's anxiety: it is the fear of a mourning          which has already occurred, at the very origin of love,    from the moment when I was first "ravished." Someone          would have to be able to tell me: "Don't be anxious any       more - you've already lost him/her."           To Love Love         annulation /       annulment        Explosion of language during which the subject       during       manages to annul the loved object under the       volume of love itself: by a specifically amorous       perversion, it is love the subject loves, not the       object.        1.       Charlotte is quite insipid; she is the paltry character of a powerful, tormented, flamboyant drama staged by the subject Werther; by a kindly decision of this subject, a colorless object is placed in the center of the stage and there adored, idolized, taken to task, covered with discourse, with prayers (and perhaps, surreptitiously, with invectives); as if she were a huge motionless hen huddled amid her feathers, around which circles a slightly mad cock.     Enough that, in a flash, I should see the other in the guise of an inert object, like a kind of stuffed doll, for me to shift my desire from this annulled object to my desire itself; it is my desire I desire, and the loved being is no more than its tool. I rejoice at the thought of such a great cause, which leaves far behind it the person whom I have made into its pretext (at least this is what I tell myself, happy to raise myself by lowering the other): I sacrifice the image to the Image-repertoire. And if a day comes when I must bring myself to renounce the other, the violent mourning which then grips me is the mourning of the Image-repertoire itself: it was a beloved structure, and I weep for the loss of love, not of him or her. (I want to go    back there, like the imprisoned child of Poitiers who       wanted to get back to her big cave Malempia.)    2. Here then the other is annulled by love: I derive a certain advantage from this annulment; should an accidental injury threaten me (a notion of jealousy, for example), I reabsorb it into the magnificence and the abstraction of amorous sentiment: I soothe myself by desiring what, being absent, can no longer harm me. Yet, imnmediately thereafter, I suffer at seeing the other (whom I love) thus diminished, reduced, and somehow excluded from the sentiment which he or she has provoked. I feel myself to be guilty and I blame myself for abandoning the other. A turnabout occurs: I seek to disannul it, I force myself to suffer once again.        To Be Ascetic         askesis           Whether he feels guilty with regard to the loved    being, or whether he seeks to impress that being       by representing his unhappiness, the amorous       subject outlines an ascetic behavior of          self-punishment (in life style, dress, etc.).           1.       Since I am guilty of this, of that (I have - I assign myself - a thousand reasons for being so), I shall punish myself, I shall chasten by body: cut my hair very short, conceal my eyes behind dark glasses (a way of taking the veil), devote myself to the study of some serious and abstract branch of learning. I shall get up early and work while it is still dark outside, like a monk. I shall be very patient, a little sad, in a word, worthy, as suits a man of resentment. I shall (hysterically) signify my mourning (the mourning which I assign myself) in my dress, my haircut, the regularity of my habits. This will be a gentle retreat; just that slight degree of retreat necessary to the proper functioning of a discrete pathos.        2. Askesis (the impulse toward askesis) is addressed       to the other: turn back, look at me, see what you have       made of me. It is a blackmail: I raise before the other the       figure of my own disappearance, as it will surely occur, if       the other does not yield (to what?).        Atopos     atopos    / atopos       The loved being is recognized by the amorous    subject as "atopos" (a qualification given to       Socrates by his interlocutors), i.e., unclassifiable,    of a ceaselessly unforeseen originality.           1. The atopia of Socrates is linked to Eros (Socrates    is courted by Alcibiades) and to the numbfish (Socrates    electrifies and benumbs Meno). The other whom I love    and who fascinates me is atopos. I cannot classify the       other, for the other is, precisely, Unique, the singular    Image which has miraculously come to correspond to the       to       specialty of my desire. The other is the figure of my truth,    and cannot be imprisoned in any stereotype (which is the       truth of others).       Yet I have loved or will love several times in my life. Does this mean, then, that my desire, quite special as it may be, is linked to a type? Does this mean that my desire is classifiable? Is there, among all the beings I have loved, a common characteristic, just one, however tenuous (a nose, a skin, a look), which allows me to say: that's my type! "Just my type" or "not my type at all" - cruising slogans: then is the lover merely a choosier cruiser, who spends his life looking for "his type"? In which corner of the adverse body must I read my truth?    2. I surprise the other's atopia on his/ her face each time I read there a certain tremendous innocence: the other knows nothing of the harm he or she has done me - or, to put it less rhetorically, of the harm he or she has given me. Is not the innocent party unclassifiable (hence suspect in every society, which "knows where it is" only where it can classify Faults)?    X had many "character traits" by which it was not difficult to classify him (he was "indiscreet," "wily," "indolent," etc.), but I had had, two or three times, occasion to read in his eyes an expression of such an innocence (no other word) that I persisted, whatever happened, in setting him, so to speak, aside from himself, outside of his own character. At that moment, I was exonerating him from all criticism or commentary. As innocence, atopia resists description, definition, language, which is maya, classification of Names (of Faults). Being Atopic, the other makes language indecisive: one cannot speak of the other, about the other; every attribute is false, painful, erroneous, awkward: the other is unqualifiable (this would be the true meaning of atopos).    3. Confronted with the other's brilliant originality, I never feel myself to be atopos, but rather classified (like an all-too-familiar dossier). Sometimes, though, I manage to suspend the action of the unequal images ("If only I could be as original, as strong as the other!"); I divine that the true site of originality and strength is neither the other nor myself, but our relation itself. It is the originality of the relation which must be conquered. Most of my injjuries come from the stereotype: I am obliged to make myself a lover, like everyone else: to be jealous, neglected, frustrated, like everyone else. But when the relation is       original, then the stereotype is shaken. transcended,    evacuated, and jealousy, for instance, has no more room       in this relation without a site, without    topos - without       what in French we call, colloquially, "topo" - without discourse.        Waiting      attente / waiting       Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the    loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous,       letters, telephone calls, returns)        1.       I am waiting for an arrival, a return, a promised       sign. This can be futile, or immensely pathetic: in          Erwatung (Waiting), a woman waits for her lover, at       night, in the forest; I am waiting for no more than a    telephone call, but the anxiety is the same. Everything is solemn: I have no sense of proportions.           2.       There is a scenography of waiting: I organize it,       manipulate it, cut out a portion of time in which I shall       mime the loss of the loved object and provoke all the       effects of a minor mourning. This is then acted out as a       play.           The setting represents the interior of a cafe; we have a rendezvous, I am waiting. In the Prologue, the sole actor of the play (and with reason), I discern and indicate the other's delay; this delay is as yet only a mathematical, computable entity (I look at my watch several times); the Prologue ends with a brainstorm: I decide to "take it badly," I release the anxiety of waiting. Act I now begins; it is occupied by suppositions: was there a misunderstanding as to the time, the place? I try to recall the moment when the rendezvous was made, the details which were supplied. What is to be done (anxiety of behavior)? Try another cafe? Telephone? But if the other comes during these absences? Not seeing me, the other might leave, etc. Act II is the act of anger; I address violent reproaches to the absent one: "All the same, he (she) could have ..." "He (she) knows perfectly well ..." Oh, if she (he) could be here, so that I could reproach her (him) forr not being here! In Act III, I attain to (I obtain?) anxiety in the pure state: the anxiety of abandonment; I have just shifted in a second from absence to death; the other is as if dead: explosion of grief: I am internally livid. That is the play; it can be shortened by the other's arrival; if the other arrives in Act I, the greeting is calm; if the other arrives in Act II, there is a "scene"; if in Act III, there is recognition, the action of grace: I breathe deeply, like Pelleas emerging from the underground chambers and rediscovering life, the odor of roses.     (The anxiety of waiting is not continuously violent; it has       its matte moments; I am waiting, and everything around    my waiting is stricken with unreality: in this cafe, I look at    the others who come in, chat, joke,    read    calmly:    they are not waiting.)           3. Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders    not to move. Waiting for a telephone call is thereby woven     out of tiny unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid    myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to    telephone (to keep the line from being busy); I suffer    torments if someone else telephones me (for the same    reason); I madden myself by the thought that at a certain    (imminent) hour I shall have to leave, thereby running    the risk of missing the healing call, the return of the    Mother. All these diversions which solicit me are so many    wasted moments for waiting, so many impurities of anxiety. For the anxiety of waiting, in its pure state, requires    that I be sitting in a chair within reach of the telephone,    without doing anything.       4.       The being I am waiting for is not real. Like the    mother's breast for the infant, "I create and re-create it    over and over, starting from my capacity to love, starting    from my need for it": the other comes here where I am    waiting, here where I have already created him/her. And    if the other does not come, I hallucinate the other: waiting    is a delirium.    The telephone again: each time it rings, I snatch up the    receiver, I think it will be the loved being who is calling    me (since that being should call me); a little more effort    and I "recognize" the other's voice, I engage in the    dialogue, to the point where I lash out furiously against       the importunate outsider who wakens me from my    delirium. In the cafe, anyone who comes in, bearing the faintest resemblance, is thereupon, in a first impulse, recognized.        And, long after the amorous relation is allayed, I keep the    habit of hallucinating the being I have loved: sometimes I am still in anxiety over a telephone call that is late, and no    matter who is on the line, I imagine I recognize the voice I    once loved: I am an amputee who still feels pain in his    missing leg.        5.    "Am I in love? - Yes. since I'm waiting." The    other never waits. Sometimes I want to play the part of the       one who doesn't wait; I try to busy myself elsewhere, to    arrive late; but I always lose at this game: whatever I do, I       find myself there, with nothing to do, punctual, even ahead       of time. The lover's fatal identity is precisely: I am the       one who waits.           (In transference, one always waits - at the doctor's, the    professor's, the analyst's. Further, if I am waiting at a       bank window, an airport ticket counter, I immediately    establish an aggressive link with the teller, the stewardess,          whose indifference unmasks and irritates my subjection; so       that one might say that wherever there is waiting there is    transference: I depend on a presence which is shared and          requires time to be bestowed - as if it were a question of          lowering my desire, lessening my need. To make someone       wait: the constant prerogative of all power, "age-old pas   time of humanity.")    6.       A mandarin fell in love with a courtesan. "I shall          be yours," she told him, "when you have spent a hundred    nights waiting for me, sitting on a stool, in my garden,    beneath my window." But on the ninety-ninth night, the       mandarin stood up, put his stool under his arm, and went       away.        Dark Glasses      cacher / to hide       A deliberative figure: the amorous subject       wonders, not whether he should declare his love    to the loved being (this is not a figure of avowal),    but to what degree he should conceal the    turbulences of his passion: his desires, his    distresses: in short, his excesses (in Racinian    language: his fureur).        1.       X, who left for his vacation without me, has shown    no signs of life since his departure: accident? post-office strike? indifference? distancing maneuver? exercise of a passing impulse of autonomy ("His youth deafens him,, he fails to hear")? or simple innocence? I grow increasingly anxious, pass through each act of the waiting-scenario. But when X reappears in one way or another, for he cannot fail to do so (a thought which should immediately dispel any anxiety), what will I say to him? Should I hide my distress - which will be over by then ("How are you?")? Release it aggressively ("That wasn't at all nice, at least you coulld have ...") or passionately ("Do you know how much worry you caused me?")? Or let this distress of mine be delicately, discreetly understood, so that it will be discovered without having to strike down the other ("I was rather concerned ...")? A secondary anxiety seizes me, which is that I must determine the degree of publicity I shall give to my initial anxiety.    2.       I am caught up in a double discourse. from which    I cannot escape. On the one hand, I tell myself: suppose       the other, by some arrangement of his own structure,       needed my questioning? Then wouldn't I be justified in       abandoning myself to the literal expression, the lyrical ut   terance of my "passion"? Are not excess and madness my       truth, my strength? And if this truth, this strength ulti   mately prevailed?          But on the other hand, I tell myself: the signs of this passion run the risk of smothering the other. Then should I not, precisely because of my love, hide from the other how much I love him? I see the other with a double vision: sometimes as object, sometimes as subject; I hesitate between tyranny and oblation. Thus I doom myself to blackmail: if I love the other, I am forced to seek his happiness; but then I can only do myself harm: a trap: I am condemned to be a saint or a monster: unable to be the one, unwilling to be the other: hence I tergiversate: I show my passion a little.     3.    To impose upon my passion the mask of discretion       (of impassivity): this is a strictly heroic value: "It is          unworthy of great souls to expose to those around them       the distress they feel" (Clotilde de Vaux); Captain Paz,          one of Balzac's heroes, invents a false mistress in order to          be sure of keeping his best friend's wife from knowing that          he loves her passionately.           Yet to hide a passion totally (or even to hide, more       simply, its excess) is inconceivable: not because the       inconceivable       human subject is too weak, but because passion is in essence made to be seen: the hiding must be seen: I want          you       to know that    I am hiding something from you, that is       the active paradox I must resolve: at one and the same    time    it must be known and not known: I want you to       know that I don 't want to show my feelings: that is the       message I address to the other. Larvatuss prodeo: I advance pointing to my mask: I set a mask upon my passion, but with a discreet (and wily) finger I designate this          mask. Every passion, ultimately, has its spectator: at    moment of his death, Captain Paz cannot keep from    writing to the woman he has loved in silence: no amorous       oblation without a final theater: the sign is always       victorious.        4.       Let us suppose that I have wept, on account of some incident of which the other has not even become aware (to weep is part of the normal activity of the amorous body), and that, so this cannot be seen, I put on dark glasses to mask my swollen eyes (a fine example of denial: to darken the sight in order not to be seen). The intention of this gesture is a calculated one: I want to keep the moral advantage of stoicism, of "dignity" (I take myself for Clotilde de Vaux), and at the same time, contradictorily, I want to provoke the tender question ("But what's the matter with you?"); I want to be both pathetic and admirable, I want to be at the same time a child and an adult. Thereby I gamble, I take a risk: for it is always possible that the other will simply ask no question whatever about these unaccustomed glasses; that the other will see, in the fact, no sign.     5.    In order to suggest, delicately, that I am suffering,       in order to hide without lying, I shall make use of a cunning preterition: I shall divide the economy of my signs.    The task of the verbal signs will be to silence, to mask, to    deceive: I shall never account, verbally, for the excesses    of my sentiment. Having said nothing of the ravages of    this anxiety, I can always, once it has passed, reassure    myself that no one has guessed anything. The power of    language:    with my language I can do everything: even and    especially say nothing.    I can do everything with my language, but not with my    body. What I hide by my language, my body utters. I can       maid       deliberately mold my message, not my voice. By my voice,    whatever it says, the other will recognize "that something    is wrong with me." I am a liar (by preterition), not an       actor. My body is a stubborn child, my language is a very    civilized adult...        6. ...so that a long series of verbal contentions    (my "politenesses") may suddenly explode into some generalized revulsion: a crying jag (for instance), before    the other's flabbergasted eyes, will suddenly wipe out all    the efforts (and the effects) of a carefully controlled language. I break apart:         Connais donc Phedre et toute sa fureur.     Now you know Phaedra and all her fury.        "Tutti Sistemati"         cases       / pigeonholed        The amorous subject secs everyone around him     as "pigeonholed," each appearing to be granted a    little practical and affective system of contractual    liaisons from which he feels himself to be    excluded; this inspires him with an ambiguous       sentiment of envy and mockery.       1.    Werther wants to be pigeonholed: " I... her       husband!! O my God who created me, if you had kept this happiness in store for me, all my life would be no more than a perpetual thank offering," etc.: Werther wants a place which is already taken - Albert's. He wants to enter into a system ("pigeonholed," in Italian, is translated as sistemato). For the system is a whole in which everyone has his place (even if it is not a good place); husbands and wives, lovers, trios, marginal figures as well (drugs, cruising), nicely installed in their marginality: everyone except me. (Game: there were as many chairs as children, minus once; while the children marched around, a lady pounded on a piano; when she stopped, everyone dashed for a chair and sat down, except the clumsiest, the least brutal, or the unluckiest, who remained standing, stupid, de trop: the lover.)       2.       How is it that the sistemati around me can inspire    me with envy? From what, seeing them, am I excluded?          Certainly not from a "dream," an "idyll," a " union":    "dream,"       un ion":    there are too many complaints from the "pigeonholed"       about their system, and the dream of union forms another figure. No, what I fantasize in the system is quite modest (a fantasy all the more paradoxical in that it has no particular vividness): I want, I desire, quite simply, a structure (this word, lately, produced a gritting of teeth: it was regarded as the acme of abstraction). Of course there is not a happiness of structure; but every structure is habitable, indeed that may be its best definition. I can perfectly well inhabit what does not make me happy; I can simultaneously complain and endure; I can reject the meaning of the structure I submit to and traverse without displeasure certain of its everyday portions (habits, minor satisfactions, little securities, endurable things, temporary tensions); and I can even have a perverse liking for this behavior of the system (which makes it, in fact, habitable): Daniel Stylites lived quite well on top of his pillar: he had made it (though a difficult thing) into a structure.       To want to be pigeonholed is to want to obtain for life a       docile reception. As support, the structure is separated       from desire: what I want, quite simply, is to be "kept,"    like some sort of superior prostitute.           3.    The other's structure (for the other always has a       life structure to which I do not belong) has something    absurd about it: I see the other insisting on living according to the same routines: kept elsewhere, the other seems       to me frozen, eternal (eternity can be conceived as ridiculous).          Each time I unexpectedly glimpsed the other in his "structure" ( sistemato), I was fascinated: I believed I was contemplating an essence: that of conjugality. When the train       passes through the big cities of Holland on its high       trestles, the traveler's gaze plunges down into the curtainless, well-lighted interiors, where each person seems busy       about his intimacy as if he were not being seen by thou   sands of passengers: that is when it is given to behold a       Family essence; and when, in Hamburg, you walk along       the streets of glass windows behind which women are       smoking and waiting, it is the essence of Prostitution that       you see. (Power    of structures: perhaps that is what is    desired in them.)       Catastrophe     catastrophe /       catastrophe    Violent crisis during which the subject,       experiencing the amorous situation as a definitive       impasse, a trap from which he can never escape,       sees himself doomed to total destruction.           1. Two systems of despair: gentle despair, active resignation ("I love you as one must love, in despair"), and violent despair: one day, after some incident, I shut myself in my room and burst into sobs: I am carried away by a powerful tide, asphyxiated with pain; my whole body stiffens and convulses: I see, in a sharp, cold flash, the destruction to which I am doomed. No relation to the insidious and "civilized" depression of amours difficiles; no relation to the fear and trembling of the abandoned subject. This is clear as a catastrophe: "I'm done for!"       (Cause? Never formal - never by a declaration of breaking off; this comes without warning, either by the effect of    an unendurable image or by an abrupt sexual rejection:    the infantile - seeing oneself abandoned by the Mother - shifts brutally to the genital.)        2.       The amorous catastrophe may be close to what has been called, in the psychotic domain, an extreme situation, "a situation experienced by the subject as irremediably bound to destroy him"; the image is drawn from what occurred at Dachau. Is it not indecent to compare the situation of a love-sick subject to that off an inmate of Dachau? Can one of the most unimaginable insults of History be compared with a trivial, childish, sophisticated, obscure incident occurring to a comfortable subject who is merely the victim of his own Image-repertoire? Yet these two situations have this in common: they are, literally. panic situations: situations without remainder, without return: I have projected myself into the other with such power that when I am without the other I cannot recover myself, regain myself: I am lost, forever.       Laetitia      circonscrire / to circumscribe        To reduce his wretchedness, the subject pins his hope on a method of control which permits him to circumscribe the pleasures afforded by the amorous relation: on the one hand, to keep these pleasures, to take full advantage of them, and on the other hand., to place within a parenthesis of the unthinkable those broad depressive zones which separate such pleasures: "to forget" the loved being outside of the pleasures that being bestows.    1.    Cicero, and later Leibnitz, opposes gaudium to    laetitia. Gaudium is "the pleasure the soul experiences when it considers the possession of a present or future good as assured; and we are in possession of such a good when it is in such a way within our power that we can enjoy it when we wish." Laetitia is a lively pleasure, "a state in which pleasure predominates within us" (among other, often contradictory sensations).        Gaudium is what I dream of: to enjoy a lifelong pleasure. But being unable to accede to Gaudium, from which I am separated by a thousand obstacles, I dream of falling back on Laetitia: if I could manage to confine myself to the lively pleasures the other affords me, without contaminating them, mortifying them by the anxiety which serves as their hinge? If I could take an anthological view of the amorous relation? If I were to understand, initially, that a great preoccupation does not exclude moments of pure pleasure (like the Chaplain in Mother Courage explaining that "war does not exclude peace"), and then, if I managed systematically to forget the zones of alarm which separate these moments of pleasure? If I could be dazed, inconsistent?    2.       This is a lunatic project, for the Image-repertoire is precisely defined by its coalescence (its adhesiveness), or again: its power of association: nothing in the image can be forgotten; an exhausting memory forbids volunrtarily escaping love; in short, forbids inhabiting it discreetly, reasonably. I can certainly imagine procedures to obtain the circumscription of my pleasures (converting the scarcity of frequentation into the luxury of the relation, in the Epicurean fashion; or again, considering the other as lost, and henceforth enjoying, each time the other returns, the relief of a resurrection), but it is a waste of effort: the amorous glue is indissoluble; one must either submit or cut loose: accommodation is impossible (love is neither dialectical nor reformist).           (A melancholy version of the circumscription of pleasures: my life is a ruin: some things remain in place,       others are dissolved, collapsed: this is dilapidation,       wreckage.)       The Heart         coeur / heart    This word refers to all kinds of movements and       desires, but what is constant is that the heart is       is       constituted into a gift-object - whether ignored       or rejected.        1.       The heart is the organ of desire (the heart swells,       weakens, etc., like the sexual organs), as it is held, enchanted, within the domain of the Image-repertoire. What    will the world, what will the other do with my desire? That    is the anxiety in which are gathered all the heart's movements, all the heart's    "problems."        2.    Werther complains of Prince van X: "He esteems my mind and my talents more than this heart of mine, which yet is my one pride ... Ah, whatever I know, anyone may know - I alone have my heart."    You wait for me where I do not want to go: you love me where I do not exist. Or again: the world and I are not interested in the same thing; and to my misfortune, this divided thing is myself; I am not interested (Werther    says) in my mind: you are not interested in my heart.       3. The heart is what I imagine I give. Each time this gift is returned to me, then it is little enough to say, with Werther, that the heart is what remains of me, once all the wit attributed to me and undesired by me is taken away: the heart is what remains to me, and this heart that lies heavy on my heart is heavy with the ebb which has filled it with itself (only the lover and the child have a heavy heart).    (X is about to leave for some weeks, and perhaps longer; at the last moment, he wants to buy a watch for his trip; the clerk simpers at him: "Would you like mine? You would have been a little boy when they cost what this one did," etc.; she doesn't know that my heart is heavy within me.)    "All the delights       of the    earth"     comblement / fulfillment        The subject insistently posits the desire and the possibility of a complete satisfaction of the desire implicated in the amorous relation and of a perfect and virtually eternal success of this relation: paradisiac image of the Sovereign Good, to be given and to be received.    1. "Now, take all the delights of the earth, melt them into once single delight, and cast it entire into a single man - all this will be as nothing to the delight of which I speak." Thus fulfillment is a precipitation: something is condensed, streams over me, strikes me like a lightning bolt. What is it which fills me in this fashion? A totality? No. Something that, starting from totality, actually exceeds it: a totality without remainder, a summa without exception, a site with nothing adjacent ("my soul is not only filled, but runs over"). I fulfill (I am fulfilled), I accumulate, but I do not abide by the level of lack; I produce an excess, and it is in this excess that the fulfillment occurs (the excessive is the realm, the system of the Image-repertoire: once I am no longer within the excessive, I feel frustrated; for me, enough means not enough): at last I know that state in which "delight exceeds the possibilities envisioned by desire." A miracle: leaving all "satisfaction"behind, neither satiated nor drunk (saoul,    in French), I pass beyond the limits of satiety, and instead of finding disgust, nausea or even drunkenness, I discover ... Coincidence. Excess has led me to proportion; I adhere to the Image, our proportions are the same: exactitude, accuracy, music: I am through with not enough. Henceforth I live in the definitive assumption of the Image-repertoire, its triumph.        Fulfillments: they are not spoken - so that, erroneously, the amorous relation seems reduced to a long complaint. This is because, if it is inconsistent to express suffering badly, on the other hand, with regard to happiness, it would seem culpable to spoil its expression: the ego discourses only when it is hurt; when I am fulfilled or remember having been so, language seems pusillanimous: I am transported, beyond language, i.e., beyond the mediocre, beyond the general: "There occurs an encounter which is intolerable, on account of the joy within it, and sometimes man is thereby reduced to nothing; this is what I call the transport. The transport is the joy of which one cannot speak."    2. In reality, it is unimportant that I have no likelihood of being really fulfilled (I am quite willing for this to be the case). Only the will to fulfillment shines, indestructible, before me. By this will., I well up: I1 form within myself the utopia of a subject free from repression: I am this subject already. This subject is libertarian: to believe in the Sovereign Good is as insane as to believe in the Sovereign Evil: Heinrich von Ofterdingen is of the same philosophical stuff as Sade's Juliette.       (Fulfillment means an abolition of inheritances: ".   ..   Joy has no need of heirs or of children - Joy wants itself,       wants eternity, the repetition of the same things, wants       everything to remain eternally the same." The fulfilled       lover has no need to write, to transmit, to reproduce.)        "I have an    Other-ache"      compassion /    compassion        The subject experiences a sentiment of violent    compassion with regard to the loved object each    time he sees, feels, or knows the loved object is    unhappy or in danger, for whatever reason       external to the amorous relation itself.        1.       "Supposing that we experienced the other as he experiences himself - which Schopenhauer calls compassion and which might more accurately be called a union within suffering, a unity of suffering - we should hate the other when he himself, like Pascal, finds himself hateful." If the other suffers from hallucinations, if he fears going mad, I should myself hallucinate, myself go mad. Now, whatever the power of love, this does not occur: I am moved, anguished, for it is horrible to see those oOne loves suffering, but at the same time I remain dry, watertight. My identification is imperfect: I am a Mother (the other causes me concern), but an insufficient Mother; I bestir myself too much, in proportion to the profound reserve in which, actually, I remain. For at the same time that I "sincerely" identify myself with the other's misery, what I read in this misery is that it occurs without me, and that by being miserable by himself, the other abandons me: if he suffers without my being the cause of his suffering, it is because I don't count for him: his suffering annuls me insofar as it constitutes him outside of myself.    2.    Whereupon, a reversal: since the other suffers without me, why suffer in his place? His misery bears him far away from me, I can only exhaust myself running after him, without ever hoping to be able to catch up, to coincide with him. So let us become a little detached, let us undertake the apprenticeship of a certain distance. Let the repressed word appear which rises to the lips of every subject, once he survives another's death: Let us live!        3.    So I shall suffer with the other., but without pressure, without losing myself. Such behavior, at once very affective and very controlled, very amorous and very civilized, can be given a name: delicacy: in a sense it is the "healthy" (artistic) form of compassion. ( Ate is the goddess of madness, but Plato speaks of Ate's delicacy: her foot is winged, it touches lightly.)     "I want to    understand"  comprendre    / to understand          Suddenly perceiving the amorous episode as a knot       of inexplicable reasons and impaired solutions, the       subject exclaims: " I want to understand (what is    happening to me)!"           1.       What do I think of love? - As a matter of fact, I       think nothing at all of love. I'd be glad to know what it is, but being inside, I see it in existence, not in essence. What I want to know (love) is the very substance I employ in order to speak (the lover's discourse). Reflection is certainly permitted, but since this reflection is immediately absorbed in the mulling over of images, it never turns into reflexivity: excluded from logic (which supposes languages exterior to each other), I cannot claim to think properly. Hence, discourse on love though I may for years at a time, I cannot hope to seize the concept of it except "by the tail": by flashes, formulas, surprises of expression, scattered through the great stream of the Image-repertoire; I am in love's wrong place, which is its dazzling place:       "The darkest place, according to a Chinese proverb, is          always underneath the lamp."       2. Coming out of the movie theater, alone, mulling over my "problem," my lover's problem which the film has been unable to make me forget, I utter this strange    cry: not: make it Stop! but: I want to understand (what is    happening to me)!    3.       Repression: I want to analyze, to know, to express in another language than mine; I want to represent my delirium to myself, I want to "look in the face"" what is dividing me, cutting me off. Understand your madness: that was Zeus' command when he ordered Apollo to turn the faces of the divided Androgynes (like an egg, a berry) toward the place where they had been cut apart (the belly) "so that the sight of their division might render them less insolent." To understand - is that not to divide the image, to undo the I, proud organ of misapprehension?     4.       Interpretation: no, that is not what your cry means. As a matter of fact, that cry is still a cry of love: "I want to understand myself, to make myself understood, make myself known, be embraced; I want someone to take me with him." That is what your cry means..       5. I want to change systems: no longer to unmask, no longer to interpret, but to make consciousness itself a drug, and thereby to accede to the perfect vision of reality, to the great bright dream, to prophetic love.     (And if consciousness - such consciousness - were our    human future? If, by an additional turn of the spiral, some day, most dazzling of all, once every reactive ideology had    disappeared, consciousness were finally to become this: the abolition of the manifest and the latent, of the appearance and the hidden? If it were asked of analysis not to destroy power (not even to correct or to direct it), but only to decorate it, as an artist? Let us imagine that the science of our lapsi were to discover, one day, its own lapsus, and that this lapsus should turn out to be: a new, unheard-of form of consciousness?)     "What is to be done?"     conduite / behavior        A deliberative figure: the amorous subject raises    (generally) futile problems of behavior: faced    with this or that alternative, what is to be done?    How is he to act?       act?           1.    Should one continue? Wilhelm, Werther's friend, is    the man of Ethics, the unpersuadable science of behavior. This ethic is actually a kind of logic: either this or else that; if I choose (if I determine) this, then once again, this or that: and so on, until, from this cascade of alternatives, appears at last a pure action - pure of all regret, all vacillation. You love Charlotte: either you have some hope, and then you will act; or else you have none, in which case you will renounce. That is the discourse of the "healthy" subject: either / or. But the amorous subject replies (as Werther does): I am trying to slip between the two members of the alternative: i.e., I have no hope, but all the same... Or else: I stubbornly choose not to choose; I choose drifting: I continue.        2. My anxieties as to behavior are futile, ever more so, to infinity. If the other, incidentally or negligently, gives the telephone number of a place where he or she can be reached at certain times, I immediately grow baffled: should I telephone or shouldn't I? (It would do no good to tell me that I can telephone - that is the objective, reasonable meaning of the message - for it is precisely this permission I don't know how to handle.)       What is futile is what apparently has and will have no consequence. But for me, an amorous subject, everything which is new, everything which disturbs, is received not as a fact but in the aspect of a sign which must be interpreted. From the lover's point of view, the fact becomes consequential because it is immediately transformed into a sign: it is the sign, not the fact, which is consequential (by its aura). If the other has given me this new telephone number, what was that the sign of? Was it an invitation to telephone right away, for the pleasure of the call, or only should the occasion arise, OoUuIt of necessity? My answer itself will be a sign, which the other will inevitably interpret, thereby releasing, between us, a tumultuous maneuvering of images. Everything signifies: by this proposition, I entrap myself, I bind myself in calculations, I keep myself from enjoyment.    Sometimes, by dint of deliberating about "nothing" (as the world sees it), I exhaust myself; then I try, in reaction, to return - like a drowning man who stamps on the floor of the sea - to a spontaneous decision (spontaneity: the great dream: paradise, power, delight): go on, telephone, since you want to! But such recourse is futile: amorous time does not permit the subject to align impulse and action, to make them coincide: I am not the man of mere "acting out" - my madness is tempered, it is not seen; it is right away that I fear consequences, any consequence: it is my fear - my deliberation - which is "spontaneous."       3.    Karma is the (disastrous) concatenation of actions (of their causes and their effects). The Buddhist wants to withdraw from karma; to suspend the play of causality; he wants to vacate the signs, to ignore the practical question: what is to be done? I cannot stop asking it, and I sigh after that suspension of karma which is nirvana. Hence the situations which happen to impose no responsibility for behavior upon me, however painful, are received in a sort of peace; I suffer, but at least I have nothing to decide; the amorous (imaginary) machinery here operates all by itself, within me; like a workman of the electronic age, or like the dunce in the last row of the classroom, all I have to do is be there;: karma (the machinery, the classroom) functions in front of me, but without me. In misery itself, I can, for a very brief interval, devise for myself a little corner of sloth.       Connivance         connivence / connivance           The subject imagines himself speaking about the    loved being with a rival person, and this image       generates and strangely develops in him a pleasure       of complicity.           1.       The person with whom I can in fact talk about the    loved being is the person who loves that being as much as I do, the way I do: my symmetric partner, my rival, my competitor (rivalry is a question of place). I can then, for once, discuss the other with someone who knows; there occurs an equality of knowledge, a delight of inclusion; in such discussion, the object is neither distanced nor lacerated; it remains interior to and protected by the dual discourse. I coincide simultaneously with the Image and with this second mirror which reflects what I am (on the rival countenance, it is my fear, my jealousy which I read). Bustling gossip, all jealousy suspended, around this absent party whose objective nature is reinforced by two converging visions: we give ourselves over to a rigorous, successful experiment, since there are two observers and since the two observations are made under the same conditions: the object is proved: I discover that I am right (to be happy, to be injured, to be anxious).    (Connivance: connivere: means at one and the same time:    I wink, I blink, I close my eyes.)     2.    Which brings us to this paradox: it is the loved    being who, in the triune relation, is virtually de trop. This       can be read in certain awkwardnesses. When the loved       object happens to complain of my rival, disparages him, I       don't know how to reply to this complaint: on the one       hand, it is "noble" not to take advantage of a confidence       which is useful to me - which seems to "reinforce" my       situation; and on the other hand, I am cautious: I know       that I occupy the same position as my rival and that,       therefore, all psychology, all value set aside, nothing can       keep me as well from being, one day, the object of dis   paragement. And sometimes it is I myself who praise my    rival to the loved being (in order to be "generous"?)       against which the loved being, strangely enough (in order    to flatter me?), protests.              3.    Jealousy is an equation involving three permutable       involving       (indeterminable) terms: one is always jealous of two persons at once: I am jealous of the one I love and of the one       who loves the one I love. The odiosamato (as the Italians          call the "rival") is also loved by me: he interests me,       intrigues me, appeals to me (see Dostoevsky's Eternal       Husband).    "When my finger       accidentally.."         contacts / contacts          The figure refers to any interior discourse       provoked by a furtive contact with the body (and       more precisely the skin) of the desired being.           1. Accidentally, Werther's finger touches Charlotte's,    their feet, under the table, happen to brush against each       other. Werther might be engrossed by the meaning of    these accidents; he might concentrate physically on these    slight zones of contact and delight in this fragment of inert    finger or foot, fetishistically, without concern for the response (like God - as the etymology of the word    tells    us - the Fetish does not reply). But in fact Werther is not       perverse, he is in love: he creates meaning, always and    everywhere, out of nothing, and it is meaning which thrills    him: he is in the crucible of meaning. Every contact, for    the lover, raises the question of an answer: the skin is       asked to reply.           (A squeeze of the hand - enormous documentation - a    tiny gesture within the palm, a knee which doesn't move    away, an arm extended,    as if quite naturally,    back of a sofa and against which the other's head gradually comes to rest - this is the paradisiac realm of subtle    and clandestine signs: a kind of festival not of the senses    but of meaning.)        2.       Charlus takes the narrator's chin and slides his    magnetized fingers up to the ears "like a barber's fingers."       This trivial gesture, which I begin, is continued by another    part of myself; without anything interrupting it physically,    it branches off, shifts from a simple function to a dazzling    meaning, that of the demand for love. Meaning (destiny)    electrifies my hand; I am about to tear open the other's    opaque body, oblige the other (whether there is a response, a withdrawal, or mere acceptance) to enter into    the interplay of meaning: I am about to make the other    speak. In the lover's realm, there is no acting out: no    propulsion, perhaps even no pleasure - nothing but signs,    a frenzied activity of language: to institute, on each    furtive occasion, the system (the paradigm) of demand    and response.        Events, Setbacks,    Annoyances      contingences / contingencies        Trivialities, incidents, setbacks, pettinesses,    irritations, the vexations of amorous existence;    any factual nucleus whose consequences intersect    the amorous subject's will to happiness, as if chance    conspired against him.          1.    "Because, this morning, X was in a good mood,       because I received a present from X, because our next       meeting is all set - but because, unexpectedly, tonight, I       ran into X accompanied by Y, because I imagined them       whispering together about me when they caught sight of       me, because this meeting has demonstrated the ambiguity          of our situation, and perhaps even X's duplicity -    euphoria has stopped."    2.       The incident is trivial (it is always trivial) but it will attract to it whatever language I possess. I immediately transform it into an important event, devised by something which resembles fate. It is a covering which falls over me, enveloping everything. Countless minor circumstances thus weave the black veil of Maya, the tapestry of illusions, of meanings, of words. I begin classifying what happens to me. The incident will now produce an irritation, like the pea under the princess's twenty mattresses; like one of the day's thoughts swarming in a dream, it will be the instigator of the lovers discourse, which will reproduce and multiply by means of the Image-repertoire's capital.    3.    In the incident, it is not the cause which pulls me up short and which echoes within me thereupon, but the structure. The entire structure of the relation comes to me as one might pull a tablecloth toward one: its disadvantages, its snares, its impasses (similarly, in the tiny lens embellishing the mother-of-pearl penholder, I could see Paris and the Eiffel Tower). I make no recriminations, develop no suspicions, search for no causes; I see in terror the scope of the situation in which I am caught up; I am not the man of resentment, but of fatality.           (For me, the incident is a sign, not an index: the element          of a system, not the efflorescence of a causality.)           4.       Sometimes, hysterically, my own body produces       the incident: an evening I was looking forward to with       delight, a heartfelt declaration whose effect, I felt, would       be highly beneficial - these I obstruct by a stomach ache,       an attack of grippe: all the possible substitutes of hysteri   cal aphonia.    The Other's Body            corps / body           Any thought, any feeling, any interest aroused in       the amorous subject by the loved body.           1.    The other's body was divided: on one side, the    body proper - skin, eyes - tender, warm; and on the other       side, the voice - abrupt, reserved, subject to fits of    remoteness, a voice which did not give what the body          gave. Or further: on one side, the soft, warm, downy,          adorable body, and on the other, the ringing, well-formed,       worldly voice - always the voice.        2.    Sometimes an idea occurs to me: I catch myself carefully scrutinizing the loved body (like the narrator watching Albertine asleep). To scrutinize means to search: I am searching the other's body, as if I wanted to see what was inside it, as if the mechanical cause of my desire were in the adverse body (I am like those children who take a clock apart in order to find out what time is). This operation is conducted in a cold and astonished fashion; I am calm, attentive, as if I were confronted by a strange insect of which I am suddenly no longer afraid. Certain parts of the body are particularly appropriate to this observation: eyelashes, nails, roots of the hair, the incomplete objects. It is obvious that I am then in the process of fetishizing a corpse. As is proved by the fact that if the body I am scrutinizing happens to emerge from its inertia, if it begins doing something, my desire changes;    if for instance I see the other thinking, my desire ceases to       be perverse, it again becomes imaginary, I return to an       Image, to a Whole: once again, I love.       (I was looking at everything in the other's face, the other's    body, coldly: lashes, toenail, thin eyebrows, thin lips, the          luster of the eyes, a mole, a way of holding a cigarette; I       was fascinated - fascination being, after all, only the ex   treme of detachment - by a kind of colored ceramicized,       vitrified figurine in which I could read, without understanding anything about it, the cause of my desire.)           Talking        declaration    / declaration           The amorous subject's propensity to talk copiously,       with repressed feeling, to the loved being, about       his love for that being, for himself, for them: the       declaration does not bear upon the avowal of love,       but upon the endlessly glossed form of the       amorous relation.           1.       Language is a skin: I rub my language against the       other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at       the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.       The emotion derives from a double contact: on the one          hand, a whole activity of discourse discreetly, indirectly       focuses upon a single signified, which is "I desire you,"       and releases, nourishes, ramifies it to the point of explo   sion (language experiences orgasm upon touching itself);       on the other hand, I enwrap the other in my words, I       caress, brush against, talk up this contact, I extend myself          to make the commentary to which I submit the relation       endure.           (To speak amorously is to expend without an end in sight,          without a crisis; it is to practice a relation without orgasm.          There may exist a literary form of this coitus reservatus:          what we call Marivaudage.)    2.    The energy of commentary shifts, follows the path       of substitutions. Initially it is for the other that I discourse       upon the relation; but this may also occur in the presence       of my confidant: from you I shift to he or she. And then,    from he or she I shift to one: I elaborate an abstract          discourse about love, a philosophy of the thing, which       would then in fact be nothing but a generalized suasion.       Retracing our steps from here, one might say that every          discussion of love (however detached its tonality) inevitably involves a secret allocution (I am addressing          someone whom you do not know but who is there, at    end of my maxims). In the Symposium. we may find this       allocution: it may well be Agathon whom Alcibiades is       addressing and whom he desires, though he is being monitored by an analyst, Socrates.           (Love's atopia, the characteristic which causes it to escape       all dissertations, would be that ultimately it is possible to       talk about love only according to a strict allocutive       determination; whether       philosophical, gnomic, lyric, or       novelistic, there is always, in the discourse upon love, a       person whom one addresses, though this person may have       shifted to the condition of a phantom or a creature still to       come. No one wants to speak of love unless it is for someone.)           The Dedication         dedicace    / dedication               An episode of language which accompanies any       amorous gift, whether real or projected; and, more       generally, every gesture, whether actual or       interior, by which the subject dedicates something       to the loved being.        1.       The amorous gift is sought out, selected, and purchased in the greatest excitement - the       kind of excitement which seems to be of the order of orgasm. Strenuously I    calculate whether this object will give pleasure, whether it       will disappoint, or whether, on the contrary, seeming too       "important," it will in and of itself betray the delirium - or the snare in which I am caught. The amorous gift is a    a    solemn one; swept away by the devouring metonymy    which governs the life of the imagination, I transfer myself       inside it altogether. By this object, I give you my All, I       touch you with my phallus; it is for this reason that I am       mad with excitement, that I rush from shop to shop, stubbornly tracking down the " right" fetish, the brilliant, suc   cessful fetish which will perfectly suit your desire.    The gift is contact, sensuality: you will be touching what I       have touched, a third skin unites us. I give X a scarf and       he wears it: X gives me the fact of wearing it; and,       moreover, this is how he, naively, conceives and    speaks of       the phenomenon. A contrario: any ethic of purity requires    that we detach the gift from the hand which gives or receives it: in Buddhist ordination, personal objects and the    three garments are offered to the bonze on a pole; the          bonze accepts them by touching them with a stick, not          with his hand; thus, in the future, everything which will be          given to him - and on which he will live - will be arranged       on a table, on the ground, or on a fan.           2.       I have this fear: that the given object may not       function properly because of some insidious defect: if it is          a box (selected very carefully), for example, the latch    doesn't work (the shop being run by society women; and,       and,       moreover, the shop is called "Because I love" - is it because I love that the latch doesn't work?). The delight of       giving the present then evaporates, and the subject knows       that whatever he gives, he does not have it.           (One does not give merely an object: X being in analysis,          Y wants to be analyzed too: analysis as a gift of love?)          The gift is not necessarily excrement, but it has, nonetheless, a vocation as waste: the gift I receive is more than I       know what to do with, it does not fit my space, it encum   bers, it is too much: " What am I going to do with your       present!"           3.       A typical argument of a "scene" is to represent to       the other what you are giving him or her (time, energy,       money, ingenuity, other relations, etc.); for it is invoking       the reply which makes any scene "move": And what    "move":       about me! Haven't I given you everything? The gift then          reveals the test of strength of which it is the instrument:       "I'll give you more than you give me, and so I will domi   nate you" (in the great Indian potlatches, whole villages          were burned, slaves slaughtered with this intention).           To declare what I am giving is to follow the family model:       look at the sacrifices we're making for you; or again: we    gave you the gift of life ( - But what the fuck do I care    about life! etc.). To speak of the gift is to place it in an       exchange economy (of sacrifice, competition, etc.); which    stands opposed to silent expenditure.       4.       "To that god, O Phaedrus, I dedicate this discourse ." One cannot give language (how to transfer it from one hand to the other?), but one can dedicate it - since the other is a minor god. The given object is reabsorbed in the sumptuous, solemn utterance of the consecration, in the poetic gesture of the dedication; the gift is exalted in the very voice which expresses it, if this voice is measured (metrical); or again: sung (lyrical); this is the very principle of the Hymn or Anthem. Being unable to give anything, I dedicate the dedication itself, into which is absorbed all I have to say:     A la tres chere, a la tres belle,     Qui remplit mon coeur de clarte,      A l'ange, a l'idole    immortelle..   .    To the beloved, the beautiful being      who fills my heart with light, to         the angel, the immortal idol...  Song is the precious addition to a blank message, entirely       contained within its address, for what I give by singing is    at once my body (by my voice) and the silence into which    you cast that body. ( Love is mute, Novalis says; only       poetry makes it speak.) Song means nothing: it is in this    that you will understand at last what it is that I give you;       as useless as the wisp of yarn, the pebble held out to his    mother by the child.        5.       Powerless to utter itself, powerless to speak, love       nonetheless wants to proclaim itself, to exclaim, to write    itself everywhere: all'acqua, all'ombra, ai monti, ai fiori,    all'erbe, ai fonti, all'eco, all'aria, ai venti... And once    the amorous subject creates or puts together any kind of    work at all, he is seized with a desire to dedicate it. What    he makes he immediately, and even in advance, wants to    give to his beloved, for whom he has worked, or will work.    The addition of the name will take its place as a way of    uttering the gift.          Yet, except for the case of the Hymn, which combines the dedication and the text itself, what follows the dedication (i.e., the work itself) has little relation to this dedication. The object I give is no longer tautological (I give you what I give you), it is interpretable; it has a meaning (meanings) greatly in excess of its address; though I write your name on my work, it is for "them" that it has been written (the others, the readers). Hence it is by a fatality of writing itself that we cannot say of a text that it is "amorous," but only, at best, that it has been created "amorously," like a cake or an embroidered slipper.    And even: less than a slipper! For the slipper has been made for your foot (your size and your pleasure); the cake has been made or selected for your taste: there is a certain adequation between these objects and your person. But writing does not possess this obligingness. Writing is dry, obtuse; a kind of steamroller, writing advances, indifferent, indelicate, and would kill "father, mother, lover" rather than deviate from its fatality (enigmatic though that fatality may be). When I write, I must acknowledge this fact (which, according to my Image-repertoire, lacerates me): there is no benevolence within writing, rather a terror: it smothers the other, who, far from perceiving the gift in it, reads there instead an assertion of mastery, of power, of pleasure, of solitude. Whence the    cruel    paradox       of the dedication: I seek at all costs to give you what    smothers you.        (We often notice that a writing subject does not have his writing "in his own image": if you love me "for myself," you do not love me for my writing (and I suffer from it). Doubtless, loving simultaneously two signifiers in the same body is too much! It doesn't happen every day - and if it should happen, by some exception, that is Coincidence, the Sovereign Good.)        6.       Hence I cannot give you what I thought I was writing for you - that is what I must acknowledge: the amorous dedication is impossible (I shall not be satisfied with a worldly or mundane signature, pretending to dedicate to you a work which escapes us both). The operation in which the other is to be engaged is not a signature. It is, more profoundly, an inscription: the other is inscribed, he inscribes himself within the text, he leaves there his (multiple) traces. If you were only the dedicatee of this book, you would not escape your harsh condition as (loved) object - as god; but your presence within the text, whereby you are unrecognizable there, is not that of an analogical figure, of a fetish, but that of a force which is not, thereby, absolutely reliable. Hence it doesn't matter that you feel continuously reduced to silence, that your own discourse seems to you smothered beneath the monstrous discourse of the amorous subject: in Teorema the "other" does not speak, but he inscribes something within each of those who desire him - he performs what the mathematicians call a catastrophe (the disturbance of one system by another): it is true that this mute figure is an angel.     "We are our    own    demons"      demons / demons        It occasionally seems to the amorous subject that    he is possessed by a demon of language which    impels him to injure himself and to expel    himself - according to Goethe's expression - from    the paradise which at other moments the amorous    relation constitutes for him.           1.    A specific force impels my language toward the       harm I may do to myself: the motor system of my discourse is the wheel out of gear: language snowballs, without any tactical thought of reality. I seek to harm myself, I       expel myself from my paradise, busily provoking within       myself the images (of jealousy, abandonment, humiliation) which can injure me; and I keep the wound open, I       feed it with other images, until another wound appears       and produces a diversion.    2.    The demon is plural ("My name is Legion," Mark          5:9). When a demon is repulsed, when I have at last       imposed silence upon him (by accident or effort), another       raises his head close by and begins speaking. The demonic       life of a lover is like the surface of a solfatara; huge       bubbles (muddy and scorching) burst, one after the other;             when one falls back and dies out, returning to the mass,       another forms and swells farther on. The bubbles          "Despair," "Jealousy," "Exclusion," " Desire," "Uncer   tainty of Behavior," "Fear of Losing Face" (the nastiest    of       all the demons) explode in an indeterminate order, one       after the next: the very disorder of Nature.          3.    How to repulse a demon (an old problem)? The          demons, especially if they are demons of language (and       what else could they be?) are fought by language. Hence I       can hope to exorcise the demonic word which is breathed       into my ears (by myself) if I substitute for it (if I have the       gifts of language for doing so) another, calmer word (I       yield to euphemism). Thus: I imagined I had escaped    from the crisis at last, when behold - favored by a long    car trip - a flood of language sweeps me away, I keep       tormenting myself with the thought, desire, regret, and       rage of the other; and I add to these wounds the discouragement of having to acknowledge that I am falling       back, relapsing; but the French vocabulary is a veritable       pharmacopoeia (poison on one side, antidote on the       other): no, this is not a relapse, only a last soubresaut, a    final convulsion of the previous demon.           Domnei         dependance / dependency           A figure in which common opinion sees the very       condition of the amorous subject, subjugated to       the loved object.        1.       The mechanics of amorous vassalage require a    fathomless futility. For, in order that dependency be manifest in all its purity, it must burst forth in the most trivial       circumstances and become inadmissible by dint of    cowardice: waiting for a phone call is somehow too crude    a dependency; I must improve upon it, without limits:    hence I shall exasperate myself with the chatter of the    women in the drugstore who are delaying my return to the    instrument to which I am subjugated; and since this call,       which I don't want to miss, will bring me some new occasion for subjugation, it is as if I were energetically behaving in order to preserve the very space of dependency, in    order to permit this dependency to function: I am distracted by dependency, but even more - a further complication - I am humiliated by this distraction.           (If I acknowledge my dependency, I do so because for me    it is a means of signifying my demand: in the realm of    love, futility is not a "weakness" or an "absurdity": it is a    strong sign: the more futile, the more it signifies and the    more it asserts itself as strength.)          2.    The other is assigned to a superior habitat, an       Olympus where everything is decided and whence everything descends upon me. These descents of decisions are       sometimes staggered, for the other, too, may be subject to       an instance beyond his powers, so that I am twice subject:       to the one I love and to his dependency. That is when I          begin to baulk; for the higher decision of which I am the       last and somehow deflated object now seems to me altogether unfair: I am no more in Fatality than as a good       tragic subject I had chosen myself. I am delivered up to       that historical stage where aristocratic power begins to       undergo the first effects of democratic demands: "No       reason that I    should be the one who," etc.        (The choice of vacation, with its complicated    calendar,       in whatever network I find myself participating, wonderfully       favors these first demands.)       Exuberance         depense / expenditure           A figure by which the amorous subject both seeks       and hesitates to place love in an economy of       pure expenditure, of "total loss."        1. Albert, a flat, ethical, conformist character,       decrees (after how many others) that suicide is a form of    cowardice. For Werther, on the contrary, suicide is not a       weakness, since it issues from a tension: "Oh, my dear    friend, if to tender one's whole being is to give evidence of    strength why should an excessive tension be weakness?"    Love-as-passion is therefore a force, a strength ("this violence, this stubborn, indomitable passion"), something    which suggests the old notion of (ischus: energy, tension, strength of character), and, closer to us, that of    Expenditure.        (This must be remembered if we would glimpse the transgressive force of love-as-passion: the assumption of sentimentality as alien    strength.)        2.    In Werther, at a certain moment, two economies    are opposed. On the one hand, there is the young lover    who lavishes his time, his faculties, his fortune without    counting the cost; on the other, there is the philistine (the    petty official) who moralizes to him: "Parcel out your       time ... Calculate your fortune," etc. On the one hand,    there is the lover Werther who expends his love every day,       without any sense of saving or of compensation, and on    the other, there is the husband Albert, who economizes his       goods, his happiness. On the one hand, a bourgeois       economy of repletion; on the other, a perverse economy of       dispersion, of waste, of frenzy (furor wertherinus).           (A British lord, and subsequently a bishop, blamed       Goethe for the epidemic of suicides provoked by Werther.       To which Goethe replied in strictly economic terms:       "Your commercial system has claimed thousands of          victims, why not grant a few to Werther?")          3.       The lover's discourse is not lacking in calculations: I rationalize, I reason, sometimes I count, either to       obtain certain satisfactions, to avoid certain injuries, or to       represent inwardly to the other, in a wayward impulse, the    wealth of ingenuity I lavish for nothing in his favor (to       yield, to conceal, not to hurt, to divert, to convince, etc.).       But these calculations are merely impatiences: no thought       of a final gain: Expenditure is open, to infinity, strength       drifts, without a goal (the loved object is not a goal: the    loved object is an object-as-thing, not an object-as-term).        4.       When amorous Expenditure is continuously       affirmed, without limit, without repetition, there occurs          that brilliant and rare thing which is called exuberance       and which is equal to Beauty: "Exuberance is Beauty.       The cistern contains, the fountain overflows." Amorous       exuberance is the exuberance of the child whose narcissistic scope and multiple pleasure nothing (as yet) constrains. Such exuberance can be interlaced with melancholy, with depressions and suicidal impulses, for the       lover's discourse is not an average of states; but such a       disequilibrium belongs to that black economy which       marks me with its aberration and, so to speak, with its    intolerable luxury.           The World       Thunderstruck     derealite / disreality           Sentiment of absence and withdrawal of reality       experienced by the amorous subject, confronting          the world.       I. "I am waiting for a telephone call, and this       waiting makes me more anxious than usual. I try to do          something, but without much success. I walk back and    forth in my room: the various objects - whose familiarity       usually comforts me - the gray roofs, the noises of the       city, everything seems inert to me, cut off, thunderstruck - like a waste planet, a Nature uninhabited by          man."       II. I leaf through a book of reproductions of a painter I       love; I can do so only distractedly. I admire this work, but       the images are frozen, and this bores me."       III. In a crowded restaurant, with friends, I am suffering    (an incomprehensible word for someone who is not in       love). This suffering comes to me from the crowd, from       the noise, from the decor (kitsch). A lid of disreality falls       over me from the lamps, the mirrored ceilings," etc.       IV. "I am alone in a cafe. It is Sunday, lunchtime. On the other side of the glass, on a poster outside, Coluche grimaces and plays the fool. I'm cold."        (The world is full without me, as in Nausea; the world    plays at living behind a glass partition; the world is in an    aquarium; I see everything close up and yet cut off, made    of some other substance; I keep falling outside myself,    without dizziness, without blur, into precision. as if I were       drugged. "Oh, when this splendid Nature, spread out here    before me, appears as frozen as a varnished miniature   ..      .")           2.       Any general conversation which I am obliged to       listen to (if not to take part in) appalls me, paralyzes me.    As for this language of the others from which I am excluded, it seems to me that these others overload it absurdly: they assert, object, argue, show off: what have I to    do with Portugal, affection for dogs, or the latest Petit    Rapporteur? I see the world - the other world - as a generalized hysteria.        3.       To escape disreality - to postpone its advent - I try to link myself to the world by bad temper. I discourse against something: "Landing in Rome, I see all Italy collapsing before my eyes; not a single item of merchandise attracts me in the shop windows; walking down the entire length of the Via dei Condotti, where ten years ago I had bought a silk shirt and thin summer socks, I find nothing but dime-store items. At the airport, the taxi driver wanted 14,000 lire instead of 7,000 because it was Corpus Christi. This country is losing on both counts: it is abolishing the differences in tastes, but not the division of classes," etc. Moreover, it suffices that I go on a little further for this aggressiveness, which keeps me lively, linked to the world, to turn to dereliction: I enter the dim    waters of disreality. " Piazza del Papolo (a holiday), with    everyone talking, is showing off (isn't that what language       is, showing off?), families, families, maschi strutting up       and down, a grim and bustling populace," etc. 1 am de    trop here, but - and this is a double grief - what I am       excluded from is not desirable to mw. Still, this way of    speaking, by a last thread of language (that of the fine       Sentence), keeps me on the brink of reality which withdraws and gradually freezes over, like young Werther's       varnished miniature (Nature, today, is the City).        4. I experience reality as a system of power. Coluche, the restaurant, the painter, Rome on a holiday, everything imposes on me its system of being; everyone is badly behaved. Isn't their impoliteness merely a plenitude? The world is full, plenitude is its system, and as a final offense this system is presented as a "nature" with which I must sustain good relations: in order to be "normal" (exempt from love), I should find Coluche funny, the restaurant J. good, T.'s painting beautiful, and the feast of Corpus Christi lively: not only undergo the system of power, but even enter into sympathy with it: "to love" reality? What disgust for the lover (for the lover's virtue)! It would be like Justine in the Monastery of Sainte-Marie-des-Bois. So long as I perceive the world as hostile, I remain linked to it: I am not crazy. But sometimes, once my bad temper is exhausted, 1I have no language left at all: the world is not "unreal" (I could then utter it: there are arts of the unreal, among them the greatest arts of all), but disreal: reality has fled from it, is nowhere, so that I no longer have any meaning (any paradigm) available to me; I do not manage to define my relations with Coluche, the restaurant, the painter, the Piazza del Popolo. What relation    can I have with a system of power if I am neither its slave       nor its accomplice nor its witness?        5.    From my seat in the cafe, I see Coluche frozen    there on the other side of the glass, laboriously preposter   ous. I find him to be idiotic to the second degree: idiotic       to be playing the fool. My gaze is implacable, like a dead       man's gaze; I laugh at no performance, however hilarious,       I accept no wink of complicity; I am severed from any          "associative traffic"; on his poster, Coluche fails to make       me associate: my conscience is cut in two by the cafe       window.           6.       Sometimes the world is unreal (I utter it differently), sometimes it is disreal (I utter it with only the greatest difficulty if at all).    This is not (it is said) the same withdrawal from reality. In the first case, my rejection of reality is pronounced through a fantasy: everything around me changes value in relation to a function, which is the Image-repertoire; the lover then cuts himself off from the world, he unrealizes it because he hallucinates from another aspect the peripeteias or the utopias of his love; he surrenders himself to the Image, in relation to which all "reality" disturbs him. In the second case, I also lose reality, but no imaginary substitution will compensate me for this loss: sitting in front of the Coluche poster, I am not "dreaming" (even of the other); I am not even in the Image-repertoire any longer. Everything is frozen, petrified, immutable,, i.e., unsubstitutable:    the Image-repertoire    is (temporarily) foreclosed. In the first moment I am neurotic, I unrealize; in    the second, I am psychotic, crazy, I disrealize.           (Yet if I manage, by some mastery of writing, to utter this    death, I begin to live again; I can posit antitheses, release    exclamations, I can sing:      Qu'il etait bleu, le ciel,    et grand l'espoir!     - L'espoir a    fui, vaincu,       vers le ciel noir ...  How blue the sky was, and how great was hope!     Hope has fled, conquered, to the black sky ...)       7.       The unreal is uttered, abundantly (a thousand    novels, a thousand poems). But the disreal cannot be    uttered; for jf I utlcr it ( if I lunge a1 it, even with a clumsy    uttered; for if I utter it (if I lunge at it, even with a clumsy or overliterary sentence), I emerge from it. Here I am in the buffet of the Lausanne railway station; at the next table, two Swiss are chattering; all of a sudden comes, for me, a free fall into the hole of disreality; but I can very quickly give this fall its insignia; that's what it is, I tell myself: "a ponderous stereotype spoken by a Swiss voice in the buffet of the Lausanne railway station." Instead of this hole, a vivid reality has just appeared:: the reality of the Sentence (a madman who writes is never entirely mad; he is a faker: no Praise of Folly is possible).    5. Sometimes, in a flash, I wake up and reverse the    direction of my fall. After I have waited anxiously in my    room in some unknown huge hotel in a foreign country,       far away from my habitual little world, suddenly a powerful sentence surfaces within my consciousness: "But what    the hell am I doing here?" It is love which then appears to       be disreal.        (Where are "things"? In amorous space, or in mundane       space? Where is "the childish underside of things"? What       is it which is childish? Is it "singing the boredom, the    suffering, the sadness, the darkness and death," etc. - which it is said the lover does? Or is it, on the contrary:    speaking, gossiping, chattering, picking over the world and    its violence, its conflicts, its stakes, its generality - which    is what the others do?)           Novel/Drama        drame / drama           The amorous subject cannot write his love story    himself. Only a very archaic form can       accommodate the event    which he declaims    without       being able to recount.        1.    In the letters he sends to his friend, Werther recounts both the events of his life and the effects of his passion; but it is literature which governs this mixture. For if I keep a journal, we may doubt that this journal relates, strictly speaking, to events. The events of amorous life are so trivial that they gain access to writing only by an immense effort: one grows discouraged writing what, by being written, exposes its own platitude: I ran into X, who was with Y" "Today X didn't call me" "X was in a bad mood," etc.: who would see a story in that? The infinitesimal event exists only in its huge reverberation: Journal of my reverberations (of my wounds, my joys, my interpretations, my rationalizations, my impulses): who would understand anything in that? Only the Other could write my love story, my novel.        2. As Narrative (Novel, Passion), love is a story which is accomplished, in the sacred sense of the word: it is a program which must be completed. For me, on the contrary., this story has already taken place; for what is event is exclusively the delight of which I have been the object and whose aftereffects I repeat ( and fail to achieve). Enamoration is a drama, if we restore to this word the archaic meaning Nietzsche gives it: "Ancient drama envisioned great declamatory scenes, which excluded action (action took place before or behind the stage)." Amorous seduction (a pure hypnotic moment) takes place before discourse and behind the proscenium of consciousness: the amorous "event" is of a hieratic order: it is my own local legend, my little sacred history that I declaim t1o0 myself, and this declamation of a fait accompli (frozen, embalmed, removed from any praxis) is the lover's discourse.    Flayed      ecorche / flayed           The particular sensibility of the amorous subject,          which renders him vulnerable, defenseless to       the slightest injuries.        1. I am "a mass of irritable substance." I have no skin (except for caresses). Parodying Socrates in the Phaedrus, once should speak of the Flayed Man, and not the Feathered Man, in matters of love.    The resistance of the wood varies depending on the place where we drive in the nail: wood is not isotropic. Nor am I; I have my "exquisite points." The map of these points is known to me alone, and it is according to them that I make my way, avoiding or seeking this or that, depending on externally enigmatic counsel; I should like this map of moral acupuncture to be distributed preventively to my new acquaintances (who, moreover, could also utilize it to make me suffer more).    2.       In order to find the grain of the wood (if one is not a cabinetmaker), one need merely drive in a nail and see if it penetrates readily. In order to discover my exquisite points, there exists an instrument which resembles a nail: this instrument is a joke: I do not suffer jokes lightly. The Image-repertoire is, in fact, a serious matter (nothing to do with being "serious-minded": the lover is not a man of    good conscience): the child who is off in the moon (the    lunar child) is not a playful child;       I, in the same way, am cut off from playing: not only does play continuously risk    bruising one of my exquisite points, but even everything    the world finds amusing seems sinister to me; you cannot    tease me without danger: irritable, hypersensitive? - Let    us say, rather, tender, easily crushed, like the fiber of certain kinds of wood.           (The subject who is under the ascendancy of the Image-repertoire "offers" nothing in the play of the signifier: he    dreams little, never pens. If he writes, his writing is    smooth as an Image, always seeking to reinstate a legible    surface of the words: anachronistic, in short, with regard    to the modern text - which, a contrario,    is defined by the    abolition of the Image-repertoire: nothing "novelistic," no       simulated Image: for Imitation, Representation, and    Analogy are forms of coalescence: outmoded.)       Inexpressible Love      ecrire / to write       Enticements, arguments, and impasses generated    by the desire to "express" amorous feeling in a    "creation" (particularly of writing).          1.       Two powerful myths have persuaded us that love       could, should be sublimated in aesthetic creation: the       Socratic myth    (loving serves    to "engender       a host of beau   tiful discourses") and the romantic myth (I shall produce       discourses an immortal work by writing my passion).           Yet Werther, who used to draw abundantly and skillfully,       cannot draw Charlotte's portrait (he can scarcely sketch       her silhouette, which is precisely the thing about her that       first captivated him). "I have lost ... the sacred, life-   giving power with which I created worlds about me.        2.       The full moon this fall,     All night long     I have paced around the pond.         No indirect means could be more effective in the expression of sadness than that "all night long." What if    I were       to try it, myself?     This summer morning, the bay sparkling,     I went    outside      To pick a wistaria.         or:      This morning, the bay sparkling,  I stayed here, motionless,  Thinking of who is gone.     On the one hand, this is saying nothing; on the other, it is          saying too much: impossible to adjust.       My expressive needs oscillate between the mild little haiku summarizing          a huge situation, and a great flood of banalities. I am both       too big and too weak for writing: I am alongside it, for       writing is always dense, violent,    indifferent to the infantile    ego which solicits it. Love has of course a complicity with       my language (which maintains it), but it cannot be lodged       in my writing.          3. I cannot write myself. What, after all, is this "I" who would write himself? Even as he would enter into the writing, the writing would take the wind out of his sails, would render him null and void - futile; a gradual dilapidation would occur, in which the other's image, too, would be gradually involved (to write on something is to outmode it), a disgust whose conclusion could only be: what's the use? What obstructs amorous writing is the illusion of expressivity: as a writer, or assuming myself to be one, I continue to fool myself as to the effects of language: I do not know that the word "suffering" expresses no suffering and that, consequently, to use it is not only to communicate nothing but even, and immediately, to annoy, to irritate (not to mention the absurdity). Someone would have to teach me that once cannot write without burying "sincerity" (always the Orpheus myth: not to turn back). What writing demands, and what any lover cannot grant it without laceration, is to sacrifice a little of his Image-repertoire, and to assure thereby, through his language, the assumption of a little reality. All I might produce, at best, is a writing of the Image-repertoire; and for that I would have to renounce the Image-repertoire of writing - would have to let myself be subjugated by my language, submit to the injustices (the insults) it will not fail to inflict upon the double Image of the lover and of his other.    The language of the Image-repertoire would be precisely       the utopia of language; an entirely original, paradisiac       language, the language of Adam - "natural, free of distortion or illusion, limpid mirror of our senses, a sensual language (die sensualische Sprache)": "In the       sensual language, all minds converse together, they need    no other language, for this is the language of nature."       4.    To try to write love is to confront the muck of    language: that region of hysteria where language is both    too much and too little, excessive (by the limitless expansion of the ego, by emotive submersion) and impoverished    (by the codes on which love diminishes and levels it).       Faced with the death of his baby son, in order to write (if    only scraps of writing), Mallarme submits himself to    parental       division:     Mere, pleure      Moi,    je pense.      Mother, weep      While I think.          But the amorous relation has made me into an atopical    subject - undivided: I am my own child: I am both    mother and father (of myself, of the other): how would I    divide the labor?          5.       To know that one does not write for the other, to       know that these things I am going to write will never cause       know       me to be loved by the one I love (the other), to know that       writing compensates for nothing, sublimates nothing, that    it is precisely there where you are not - this is the beginning of writing.           The Ghost Ship         errance / errantry           Though each love is experienced as unique and       though the subject rejects the notion of repeating it          elsewhere later on, he sometimes discovers in          himself a kind of diffusion of amorous desire;    he       then realizes he is doomed to wander until he dies,       from love to love.        1. How does a love end? - Then it does end? To tell the truth, no one - except for the others - ever knows anything about it; a kind of innocence conceals the end of this thing conceived, asserted, lived according to eternity. Whatever the loved being becomes, whether he vanishes or moves into the realm of Friendship, in any case I never see him disappear: the love which is over and done with passes into another world like a ship into space, lights no longer winking: the loved being once echoed loudly, now that being is entirely without resonance (the other never disappears when and how we expect). This phenomenon results from a constraint in the lover's discourse: I myself cannot (as an enamored subject) construct my love story to the end: I am its poet (itSs bard) only for the beginning; the end, like my own death, belongs to others; it is up to them 1t0o write the fiction, the external, mythic narrative.    2.    I always behave - I insist upon behaving, whatever       I am told and whatever my own discouragements may be,       as if love might someday be fulfilled, as if the Sovereign       Good were possible. Whence that odd dialectic causes one absolute love to succeed another without the least embarrassment, as if, by love, I acceded to another logic (the absolute is no longer obliged to be unique), to another temporality (from love to love, I live my vertical moments), to another music (this sound, without memory, severed from any construction, oblivious of what precedes it and of what follows, is in itself musical). I search, I begin, I try, I venture further, I run ahead, but I never know that I am ending: it is never said of the Phoenix that it dies, but only that it is reborn (then I can be reborn without dying?).    Once I am not fulfilled and yet do not kill myself,    amorous errantry is a fatality. Werther himself experienced it - shifting from "poor Leonora" to Charlotte; the    impulse, of course, is checked; but if it had survived,    Werther would have rewritten the same letters to another    woman.           3.       Amorous errantry has its comical side: it resembles a ballet, more or less nimble according to the velocity of the fickle subject; but it is also a grand opera. The accursed Dutchman is doomed to wander the seas until he has found a woman who will be eternally faithful. I am that Flying Dutchman; I cannot stop wandering (loving) because of an ancient sign which dedicated me, in the remote days of my earliest childhood, to the god of my Image-repertoire, afflicting me with a compulsion to speak which leads me to say "I love you" in one port of call after another, until some other receives this phrase and gives it back to me; but no one can assume the impossible reply (of an insupportable fulfillment), and my wandering, my errantry continues.           4.    Throughout life, all of love's "failures" resemble one another (and wiith reason: they all proceed from the same flaw)., X and Y have not been able (have not wanted) ) to answer my "demand," to adhere to my "truth"; they have not altered their system one iota; for me, the former has merely repeated the latter. And yet X and Y are incomparable; it is in their difference, the model of an infinitely pursued difference, that I find the energy to begin all over again. The "perpetual mutability" (in constantia constans) which animates me, far from squeezing all those I encounter into the same functional type (not to answer my demand), violently dislocates their false community: errantry does not align - it produces iridescence: what results is the nuance. Thus I move on, to the end of the tapestry, from one nuance to the next (the nuance is the last state of a color which can be named; the nuance is the Intractable).        "In the loving calm       of your arms"     etreinte / embrace          The gesture of the amorous embrace seems to       fulfill, for a time, the subject's dream of total       union with the loved being.        1.    Besides intercourse (when the Image-repertoire goes to the devil), there is that other embrace, which is a motionless cradling: we are enchanted, bewitched: we are in the realm of sleep, without sleeping; we are within the voluptuous infantilism of sleepiness: this is the moment for telling stories, the moment of the voice which takes me, siderates me, this is the return to the mother ("In the loving calm of your arms," says a poem set to music by Duparc). In this companionable incest, everything is suspended: time, law, prohibition: nothing is exhausted, nothing is wanted: all desires are abolished, for they seem definitively fulfilled.    2. Yet, within this infantile embrace, the genital unfailingly appears; it cuts off the diffuse sensuality of the    incestuous embrace; the logic of desire begins to function,    the will-to-possess returns, the adult is superimposed upon the child. I am then two subjects at once: I want maternity          and genitality. (The lover might be defined as a child       getting an erection: such was the young Eros.)           3.    A moment of a affirmation; for a certain time, though a finite one, a deranged interval, something has been successful: I have been fulfilled (all my desires abolished by the plenitude of their satisfaction): fulfillment does exist, and I shall keep on making it return: through all the meanderings of my amorous history, I shall persist in wanting to rediscover, to renew the contradiction - the contraction - of the two embraces.        Exiled from the       Image-repertoire         exil / exile           Deciding to give up the amorous condition, the       subject sadly discovers himself exiled from his       Image-repertoire.        1.       Let me take Werther at that fictive moment (in the          fiction itself) when he might have renounced suicide. Then       the only thing left to him is exile: not to leave Charlotte       (he has already done so once, with no result), but to exile    himself from her image, or worse still: to cut off that    raving energy known as the Image-repertoire. Then begins    "a kind of long insomnia." That is the price to be paid:          the death of the Image for my own life.           ( Amorous passion is a delirium; but such delirium is not    alien; everyone speaks of it, it is henceforth tamed. What    is enigmatic is the loss of delirium: one returns to...    what?)        2. In real mourning, it is the "test of reality" which shows me that the loved object has ceased to exist. In amorous mourning, the object is neither dead nor remote. It is I who decide that its image must die (and I may go so far as to hide this death from it). As long as this strange mourning lasts,, I will therefore have to undergo two contrary miseries: to suffer from the fact that the other is present (continuing, in spite of himself, to wound me) and to suffer from the fact that the other is dead (dead at least as I loved him). Thus I am wretched (an old habit) over a telephone call which does not come, but I must remind myself at the same time that this silence, in any casce, is insignificant, siince I have decided to get over any such concern;: it was merely an aspect of the amorous image that it was to telephone me; once this image is gone, the telephone,, whether it rings or not, resumes its trivial existence.    (Isn't the most sensitive point of this mourning the fact that I must lose a language - the amorous language? No more "I love you's.")    3. Mourning for the image, insofar as I fail to perform it, makes me anxious; but insofar as I succeed in performing it, makes me sad. If exile from the Image-repertoire is the necessary road to "cure," it must be admitted that such progress is a sad one. This sadness is not a melancholy - or, at least, it is an incomplete melancholy (and not at all a clinical one), for I accuse myself of nothing, nor am I prostrated. My sadness belongs to that fringe of melancholy where the loss of the loved being remains abstract. A double lack: I cannot even invest my misery, as I could when I suffered from being in love. In those days I desired, dreamed, struggled; the benefit lay before me, merely delayed, traversed by contretemps.        Now, no more resonance. Everything is calm, and that is       worse. Though justified by an economy - the image dies       so that I may live - amorous mourning always has something left over: one expression keeps recurring: "What a       shame!"        4. A proof of love: I sacrifice my Image-repertoire to you - the way a head of hair used to be dedicated. Thus, perhaps (at least, so it is said) I shall accede to "true love." If there is some resemblance between the amorous crisis and the analytic cure, I then go into mourning for my beloved, as the patient goes into mourning for his analyst: I liquidate my transference, and apparently this is how both the cure and the crisis end up. However, as has been pointed out, this theory forgets that the analyst, too,, must go into mourning for his patient (or else the analysis risks being interminable); in the same way, the loved being - if I sacrifice to that being an Image-repertoire which nonetheless importuned him - the loved being must enter into the melancholy of his own collapse. And concurrently with my own mourning, I must anticipate and assume this melancholy on the part of the other, from which I shall suffer, for I love the Other still.    The true act of mourning is not to suffer from the loss of the loved object; it is to discern one day, on the skin of the relationship, a certain tiny stain, appearing there as the symptom of a certain death: for the first time I am doing harm to the one I love, involuntarily, of course, but without panic.    5. I try to wrest myself away from the amorous          Image-repertoire: but the Image-repertoire burns underneath,    like an incompletely extinguished peat fire; it catches again; what was renounced reappears; out of the hasty grave suddenly breaks a long cry.          (Jealousies, anxieties, possessions, discourses, appetites, signs, once again amorous desire was burning everywhere. It was as if I were trying to embrace one last time, hysterically, someone about to die - someone for whom I was about to die: I was performing a denial of separation.)       The Orange      facheux / irksome        Sentiment of slight jealousy which overcomes the amorous subject when he sees the loved being's interest attracted or distracted by persons, objects, or occupations which in his eyes function as so many secondary rivals.    1.       Werther: "The oranges I had set aside, the only ones as yet to be found, produced an excellent effect, though at each slice which she offered, for politeness's sake, to an indiscreet neighbor, I felt my heart to be somehow pierced through." The world is full of indiscreet neighbors with whom I must share the other. The world is in fact just that: an obligation to share. The world (the worldly) is my rival. I am continually disturbed by intruders: a vague connection, met by chance and who forces his way into our company, sits down at our table; neighbors in the restaurant whose vulgarity visibly fascinates the other, to the point where he is unaware if I am speaking to him or not; even an object, a book for instance, in which the other is absorbed (I am jealous of the book). Everything is irksome which briefly erases the dual relation, which alters the complicity and relaxes the intimacy: "You belong to me as well," the world says.       2.       Charlotte shares her orange for politeness's sake,       or, one might say, out of kindness; but these are motives       which do not satisfy the lover: "It was scarcely worth my       while to set aside these oranges for her, since she gives    them to others," Werther probably tells himself. Any       obedience to worldly procedures appears as a compromise       on the part of the loved being, and this compromise alters       that being's image. An insoluble contradiction: on the one       hand, Charlotte must certainly be "kind," since she is a          perfect object; but on the other hand, this kindness must          not have the effect of abolishing the privilege which constitutes my very being. This contradiction eventuates in a       vague resentment; my jealousy is indeterminate: it is       addressed quite as much to the intruder as to the loved          being who receives the intruder's demand without seeming       to suffer from it: I am vexed with the others, with the       other, with myself (from which a "scene" can be generated).           Fade-out         fading / fade-out           Painful ordeal in which the loved being appears    to withdraw from all contact, without such       enigmatic indifference even being directed against       the amorous subject or pronounced to the       advantage of anyone else, world or rival.           1.    In the text, the fade-out of voices is a good thing;       the voices of the narrative come, go, disappear, overlap;    we do not know who is speaking; the text speaks, that is    all: no more image, nothing but language. But the other is    not a text, the other is an image, single and coalescent; if    the voice is lost, it is the entire image which vanishes (love       is monologic, maniacal; the text is heterologic, perverse). The other's fade-out, when it occurs, makes me anxious because it seems without cause and without conclusion. Like a kind of melancholy mirage, the other withdraws    into infinity and I wear myself out trying to get there.       (When this garment was at the height of fashion, an American firm advertised the washed-out blue of its jeans by       claiming: "It fades and fades and fades." The loved being,    in the same way, endlessly withdraws and pales: a feeling    of madness, purer than if this madness were violent.)    (Lacerating fade-out: just before dying, the Narrator's    grandmother, for moments at a time, neither sees nor    hears; she no longer recognizes the child, and stares at him       "with an astonished, suspicious, scandalized look.")          2.    There are nightmares in which the Mother appears, her face hardened into a cold and severe expression. The fade-out of the loved object is the terrifying return of the Wicked Mother, the inexplicable retreat of       love, the well-known abandonment of which the Mystics    complain: God exists, the Mother is present, but they no       longer love. I am not destroyed, but dropped here, a re   ject.        3.       Jealousy causes less suffering, for at least the other       remains vivid and alive. In the fade-out, the other seems    to lose all desire, invaded by the Night. I am abandoned    by the other, but this abandonment is intensified by the          abandonment the other himself suffers; his image is       thereby washed out, liquidated; I can no longer sustain          myself upon anything, even the desire the other might       experience elsewhere: I am in mourning for an object       which is itself in mourning (which suggests how much we       need the other's desire, even if this desire is not addressed       to us). us)           4.       When the other is affected by this fade-out, when       he withdraws for no particular reason except an anxiety       accounted for only in these wretched words: "I don't feel    well," he seems to move away in a mist; not dead, but    living without contour in the realm of the Shades; Ulysses    visited them, called them up, finding among them the          shade of his mother; thus I appeal to and summon up the       other, the Mother, but what comes is merely a shade.          5.       The other's fade-out resides in his voice. The voice    supports, evinces, and so to speak performs the disappear   ance of the loved being, for it is characteristic of the voice       to die. What constitutes the voice is what, within it,       lacerates me by dint of having to die, as if it were at once       and never could be anything but a memory. This phantom       being of the voice is what is dying out, it is that sonorous          texture which disintegrates and disappears. I never know       the loved being's voice except when it is dead, remembered, recalled inside my head, way past the ear; a       tenuous yet monumental voice, since it is one of those    objects which exist only once they have disappeared.       (A voice asleep, a voice no longer inhabited, a voice          acknowledging, at a great distance, the blank fatality.    6. Nothing more lacerating than a voice at once beloved and exhausted: a broken, rarefied, bloodless voice,       broken       one might say, a voice from the end of the world, which    will be swallowed up far away by cold depths: such a       voice is about to vanish, as the exhausted being is about to       die: fatigue is infinity: what never manages to end. That          brief, momentary voice, almost ungracious in its rarity,          that almost nothing of the loved and distant voice, becomes       in me a sort of monstrous cork, as if a surgeon were       thrusting a huge plug of wadding into my head.           7. Freud, apparently, did not like the telephone,       however much he may have liked listening. Perhaps he       felt, perhaps he foresaw that the telephone is always a    cacophony, and that what it transmits is the wrong voice,    the false communication.... No doubt I try to deny    separation by the telephone - as the child fearing to lose       its mother keeps pulling on a string; but the telephone wire       is not a good transitional object, it is not an inert string; it    is charged with a meaning, which is not that of junction       but that of distance: the loved, exhausted voice heard over       the telephone is the fade-out in all its anxiety. First       of all,    this voice, when it reaches me, when it is here, while it       (with great difficulty) survives, is a voice I never entirely    recognize; as if it emerged from under a mask (thus we    are told that the masks used in Greek tragedy had a       magical function: to give the voice a chthonic origin, to       distort, to alienate the voice, to make it come from some   where under the earth). Then, too, on the telephone the other is always in a situation of departure; the other departs twice over, by voice and by silence: whose turn is it       to speak? We fall silent in unison: crowding of two voids.       I'm going to leave you, the voice on the telephone says       with each second.        (Episode of anxiety experienced by the Proustian narrator, when he telephones his grandmother: anxiety conferred by the telephone: the true signature of love.)    8.    I am alarmed by everything which appears to alter    the Image. I am, therefore, alarmed by the other's fatigue:       am,       it is the cruelest of all rival objects. How combat exhaustion? I can see that the other, exhausted, tears off a frag   ment of this fatigue in order to give it to me. But what am    I to do with this bundle of fatigue set down before me?    What does this gift mean? Leave me alone? Take care of       me? No one answers, for what is given is precisely what       for       does not answer.        (In no love story I have ever read is a character ever tired.       (In       I had to wait for Blanchot for someone to tell me about       Fatigue.)          At Fault         fautes / faults           In various contingencies of everyday life, the       subject imagines he has failed the loved being and       thereby experiences a sentiment of guilt.        1.       "As soon as they reached the train station, he       noticed, though without mentioning it, a signboard giving       the location of the second-class cars and of the dining car;       the locations seemed so far away, at the very end of the       curving platform, that he had not dared take the precaution - after all, an overprotective one - of leading X in       that direction to wait for the train; it would have been, he       thought, a kind of cowardice, an obsequious submission to       the railway code: studying signboards, terror of being late,       surrender to platform hysterics - were they not all characteristics of the old, the infirm? Besides, suppose he was       mistaken? How silly to run all the way down the platform,       like those fools who limp along, loaded down with packages! Yet that is just what happened: the train passed       through the station and stopped very far down the track.       X gave him a quick hug and ran ahead; as did several       young vacationers in bathing suits. After that, he saw       nothing more, except the bulging rear end of the last car,       far ahead. No sign (such a thing was impossible), no       farewell. The train still did not move. Yet he dared not       move, leave the platform, though it was quite useless to       remain where he was. A kind of symbolic constraint (the       powerful constraint of a minor symbolism) forced him to       stay where he was, as long as the train stayed there (with       X inside). So he didn't move, stupid, seeing nothing except the faraway train, seen by no one on the empty platform - impatient, finally, for the train to leave. But he    would have been at fault had he left first, and this fault       might have haunted him for a long time."        2.       Any fissure within Devotion is a fault: that is the       rule of Cortezia. This fault occurs whenever I make any       gesture of independence with regard to the loved object;       each time I attempt, in order to break my servitude, to       "think for myself" (the world's unanimous advice), I feel       guilty. What J am guilty of, then, is paradoxically lightening the burden, reducing the exorbitant load of my devotion - in short, "managing" (according to the world); in       fact, it is being strong which frightens me, it is control (or       its gesticulation) which makes me guilty.        3.       Every pain, every misfortune, Nietzsche remarks,       has been falsified by a notion of guilt, of being at fault:       "We have deprived pain of its innocence." Passionate love       (the lover's discourse) keeps succumbing to this falsification. Yet there might be the possibility of an innocent       suffering in this kind of love, of an innocent misery (if I       were faithful to the pure Image-repertoire, and if I were to       reproduce within myself only the infantile dyad, the suffering of the child separated from its mother); I should then       not accuse what lacerates me, I might even affirm suffering. Such would be the innocence of passion: not a purity       at all, but quite simply the rejection of Fault. The lover       would be as innocent as Sade's heroes. Unfortunately, his       suffering is in most cases intensified by its double, Wrongdoing: I am frightened by the other " more than by my       father."       "Special Days"         fete / festivity        The amorous subject experiences every meeting    with the loved being as a festival.        1.       The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an       unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like       the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere       presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions:       I am about to have before me, and for myself, the "source       Lacan       of all good things."        "I am living through days as happy as those God keeps for       his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can       never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life."           2.    "That night - I tremble to speak of it! - I held her       in my arms, pressed to my heart, I kept kissing her lips,       which murmured words of love, and my eyes drowned in       the intoxication of hers! Lord God, am I to blame if even       now I experience a heavenly joy in recalling those passionate pleasures, in reliving them in the depths of my       being!"           For the Lover, the Man-in-the-Moon, the Festivity is a       jubilation, not an explosion: I delight in the dinner, the       conversation, the tenderness, the secure promise of plea   sure: "an ars vivendi over the abyss."    (Then is it nothing, for you, to be someone's festivity?)    "I am crazy"      fou / mad           It frequently occurs to the amorous subject that       he is or is going mad.           1.       I am mad to be in love, I am not mad to be able to    say so, I double my image: insane in my own eyes (I know    my delirium), simply unreasonable in the eyes of someone    else, to whom I quite sanely describe my madness: conscious of this madness, sustaining a discourse upon it.           Werther meets a madman in the mountains: in midwinter,    he wants to pick flowers for Charlotte, whom he has    loved. This man, during the time he was in a padded cell,    was happy: he no longer knew anything about himself.    Werther half recognizes himself in the madman seeking    flowers: mad with passion, like himself, but deprived of    any access to the (supposed) happiness of unconsciousness: he suffers from having failed his own madness.        2.       Every lover is mad, we are told. But can we    imagine a madman in love? Never - I am entitled only to    an impoverished, incomplete, metaphorical madness: love    drives me nearly mad, but I do not communicate with the    supernatural, there is nothing of the sacred within me; my    madness, a mere irrationality, is dim, even invisible; besides, it is entirely recuperated by the culture: it frightens    no one. (Yet it is in the amorous state that certain rational    subjects suddenly realize that madness is very close at    hand, quite possible: a madness in which love itself would    founder.)        3.    For a hundred years, (literary) madness has been    thought to consist in Rimbaud's "Je est un autre": madness is an experience of depersonalization. For me as an    amorous subject, it is quite the contrary: it is becoming a    subject, being unable to keep myself from doing so, which    drives me mad. I am not someone else: that is what I    realize with horror.           (A Zen story: An old monk busies himself in the hottest    weather drying mushrooms. "Why don't you let others do    that?" "Another man is not myself, and I am not another.    Another cannot experience my action. I must create my    experience of drying mushrooms.")           I am indefectibly myself, and it is in this that I am mad: I    am mad because I consist.        4.       A man is mad if he is pure of all power. - But    doesn't the lover experience any excitation of power? Subjection, though, is my business: subjected, seeking to subject the other, I experience in my fashion the will to    power, the libido dominandi: do I not possess, like political systems, a strong, articulated discourse? Yet this is my    singularity: my libido is entirely enclosed: I inhabit no    other space but the amorous duel: not an atom outside,    hence not an atom of gregarity: I am crazy, not because I    am original Ca crude ruse of conformity), but because I    am severed from all sociality. If other men are always, to    various degrees, the militants of something, I am the    soldier of nothing, not even of my own madness: I do not    socialize (as it is said of someone that he doesn't    symbolize).       "Looking    embarrassed"   gene / embarrassment        A group scene in which the implicit nature of the    amorous relation functions as a constraint and    provokes a collective embarrassment which is    not spoken.           1.    Werther is making a scene (just before his suicide) with Charlotte, but the scene is interrupted by       Albert's arrival. No one speaks, and the three move about    in the room, looking embarrassed; various trivial subjects       of conversation are launched, all of which fall flat. The       situation is charged. With what? With the fact that each       person is perceived by the other two in his role (of husband, of lover, of stake), without its being possible to take       account of this role in the conversation. What is heavy is       the silent knowledge: I know that you know that I know:       this is the general formula of embarrassment, a frozen,       white modesty which takes the insignificance (of remarks)       as its insignia. Paradox: the unspoken as the symptom       ... of the conscious.        2.    Accident happens to bring together several friends       in this cafe: a whole bundle of affects. The situation is       charged; though I am involved in it and even suffer from       it, I experience it as a scene, a carefully drawn and well composed tableau (something like a slightly perverse       123       Greuze); the situation is crammed with meanings, I read       them, I follow them in their last articulations; I observe, I       decipher, I enjoy a text bursting with legibility for the       reason that it do es not speak. I merely see what is spoken,       as in a silent movie. There is generated in me Ca contradiction in terms) a kind of alert fascination: I am       nailed to the scene and yet very wide awake: my attention       constitutes a part of what is being acted out, nothing is       external to the scene, and yet I read it: there are no footlights - this is an extreme theater. Whence the awkwardness - or, for some perverse types, the pleasure.           Gradiva         Gradiva / Gradiva           This name, borrowed from Jensen's book analyzed       by Freud, designates the image of the loved being       insofar as that being agrees to enter to some       degree into the amorous subject's delirium in order       to help him escape from it.        1. The hero of Gradiva is an excessive lover: he    hallucinates what others would merely evoke. The classical Gradiva, a figure of the woman he loves unknowingly,       is perceived as a real person: that is his delirium. The       woman, in order to release him from it gently, initially       conforms to his delirium; she enters into it a little, consents to play the part of Gradiva, to sustain the illusion       somewhat and not to waken the dreamer too abruptly,       gradually to unite myth and reality, by means of which the       Freud       amorous experience assumes something of the same function as an analytic cure.           2.       Gradiva is a figure of salvation, of fortunate       escape, a kindly Eumenid. But just as the Eumenides are       merely former Erinyes, goddesses of torment, there also       exists, in the amorous realm, a "wicked" Gradiva. The       loved being, if only unconsciously and for motives which       may proceed from his own neurotic advantage, then seems       to be determined to lodge me even deeper in my delirium,       to sustain and to aggravate the amorous wound: like those       parents of schizophrenics who, it is said, continually provoke or aggravate their child's madness by minor conflictive interventions, the other attempts to drive me mad. For       instance: the other sets about making me contradict myself (which has the effect of paralyzing any language in       me); or again, the other alternates actions of seduction       with actions of frustration (this is a commonplace of the       amorous relation); the other shifts without warning from       one regime to another, from intimate tenderness and complicity to coldness, to silence, to dismissiveness; or finally,       in an even more tenuous fashion, though no less wounding, the other sets about "breaking" the conversation,       either by forcing it to shift suddenly from a serious subject       (which matters to me) to a trivial one, or by being       obviously interested, while I am speaki ng, in something       else than what I am saying. In short, the other keeps       bringing me back to my own impasse: I can neither escape       from this impasse nor rest within it, like the famous Cardinal Balue shut up in a cage where he could neither stand       nor lie down.           3.    How can the being who has captured me, taken me       in the net, release me, part the meshes? By delicacy. When       Martin Freud, as a child, had been humiliated during a       skating party, his father hears him out, speaks to him, and       releases him, as if he were freeing an animal caught in a       poacher's net: "Very tenderly, he parted the meshes which       held the little creature, showing no haste and resisting       without impatience the jerks the animal made to free itelf, until he had disentangled them all and the creature       could run away, forgetting all about the whole episode."       4.       It will be said to the lover - or to Freud: it was    easy for the false Gradiva to enter somewhat into her    lover's delirium, she loved him too. Or rather, explain to    us this contradiction: on the one hand, Zoe wants Norbert       (she wants to be one with him), she is in love with him;    and on the other hand - an exorbitant thing for an amorous subject - she retains control over her feelings, she    is not delirious, since she is capable of feigning. How then    can Zoe both "love" and "be in love"? Are not these two    projects supposed to be different, the one noble, the other    morbid?           Loving and being in love have difficult relationships with    each other: for if it is true that being in love is unlike    anything else (a drop of being-in-love diluted in some    vague friendly relation dyes it brightly, makes it incomparable: I know right away that in my relation with X, Y,    however prudently I restrain myself, there is a certain    amount of being-in-love), it is also true that in being-in-love there is a certain amount of loving: I want to possess,    fiercely, but I also know how to give, actively. Then who    can manage this dialectic successfully? Who, if not the    woman, the one who does not make for any object but    only for... giving? So that if a lover manages to    "love," it is precisely insofar as he feminizes himself, joins    the class of Grandes Amoureuses, of Women Who Love    Enough to Be Kind. Perhaps this is why it is Norbert who    is delirious and Zoe who loves.    Blue Coat and    Yellow Vest      habit / habiliment        Any affect provoked or sustained by the clothing    which the subject has worn during the amorous    encounter, or wears with the intention of seducing    the loved object.           1.       Because of a forthcoming encounter - one I anticipate with exaltation - I dress very carefully, I perform       my toilet with every scruple. This word has only "official"       meanings; not to mention the scatological usage, it also       designates " the preparations given to the prisoner condemned to death before he is led to the scaffold"; or again,       "the transparent and oily membrane used by butchers to       cover certain cuts of meat." As if, at the end of every       toilet, inscribed within the excitation it provokes, there       were always the slaughtered, embalmed, varnished body,       prettified in the manner of a victim. In dressing myself, I       embellish that which, by desire, will be spoiled.        2.    Socrates: "I therefore have decked myself out in       finery so that I might be in the company of a fine young       man. " I must resemble whom I love. I postulate (and it is       this which brings about my pleasure) a conformity of essence between the other and myself. Image, imitation: I       do as many things as I can in the other's fashion. I want to       be the other, I want the other to be me, as if we were       united, enclosed within the same sack of skin, the garment       being merely the smooth envelope of that coalescent substance out of which my amorous Image-repertoire is       made.        3.       Werther: "How much it cost me to make myself       give up the very simple blue coat that I was wearing the       first time I danced with Lotte; but it had finally worn out       altogether. So I had had another one made, absolutely       identical to the first... " It is in this garment (blue coat       and yellow vest) that Werther wants to be buried, and       which he is wearing when he is found dying in his room.       Each time he wears this garment (in which he will die),       Werther disguises himself. As what? As an enchanted       lover: he magically re-creates the episode of the enchantment, that moment when he was first transfixed by the       Image. This blue garment imprisons him so effectively that       the world around him vanishes: nothing but the two of us:       by this garment, Werther forms for himself a child's body       in which phallus and mother are united, with nothing left       over. This perverse outfit was worn across Europe by the       novel's enthusiasts, and it was known as a "costume a la    Werther."           Identifications         identification / identification           The subject painfully identifies himself with some       person (or character) who occupies the same       position as himself in the amorous structure.        1.    Werther identifies himself with every lost lover: he    is the madman who loved Charlotte and goes out picking    flowers in midwinter; he is the young footman in love with    a widow, who has just killed his rival - indeed, Werther    wants to intercede for this youth, whom he cannot rescue    from the law: "Nothing can save you, poor wretch! Indeed, I see that nothing can save us." Identification is not    a psychological process; it is a pure structural operation: I    am the one who has the same place I have.           2.       I devour every amorous system with my gaze and    in it discern the place which would be mine if I were a    part of that system. I perceive not analogies but homologies: I note, for instance, that I am to X what Y is to    Z; everything I am told about Y affects me powerfully,    though Y's person is a matter of indifference to me, or    even unknown; I am caught in a mirror which changes    position and which reflects me wherever there is a dual    structure. Worse still: it can happen that on the other    hand I am loved by someone I do not love; now, far from    helping me (by the gratification it implies or the diversion    it might constitute), this situation is painful to me: I see    myself in the other who loves without being loved, I recognize in him the very gestures of my own unhappiness,    but this time it is I myself who am the active agent of this    unhappiness: I experience myself both as victim and as    executioner.        (It is because of this homology that the love story    "works" - sells. )           3.       X is more or less desired, flattered, by others than    by me. Hence I put myself in their place, as Werther is in    the same place as Heinrich, the madman with the flowers,    who has loved Charlotte to the point of madness. Now,    this structural analogy (certain points are arranged in a    certain order around one point) is readily imaginable in    terms of personality: since Heinrich and I occupy the    same place, it is no longer merely with Heinrich's place    that I identify myself, but with his image as well. A    hallucination seizes me: I am Heinrich! This generalized    identification, extended to all those who surround the    other and benefit from the other as I do, is doubly painful    er    to me: it devalues me in my own eyes       find myself    reduced to a certain personality), but it also devalues my    other, who becomes the inert object of a circle of rivals.    Each, identical with the others, seems to be shouting:    Mine! mine! Like a mob of children arguing over a ball or    any other object; in short, over the fetish thrown into their    midst.           The structure has nothing to do with persons; hence (like    a bureaucracy) it is terrible. It cannot be implored - I    cannot say to it: "Look how much better I am than H."    Inexorable, the structure replies: "You are in the same    place; hence you are H." No one can plead against the    structure.        4.    Werther identifies himself with the madman, with    the footman. As a reader, I can identify myself with    Werther. Historically, thousands of subjects have done so,    suffering, killing themselves, dressing, perfuming themselves, writing as if they were Werther (songs, poems,    candy boxes, belt buckles, fans, colognes a la Werther). A    long chain of equivalences links all the lovers in the world.    In the theory of literature, " projection" (of the reader into    the character) no longer has any currency: yet it is the    appropriate tonality of imaginative readings: reading a    love story, it is scarcely adequate to say I project myself; I    cling to the image of the lover, shut up with this image in    the very enclosure of the book (everyone knows that such    stories are read in a state of secession, of retirement, of    voluptuous absence: in the toilet).          Images         image / image           In the amorous realm, the most painful wounds       are inflicted more often by what one sees than by       what one knows.        1.    ("Suddenly, coming back from the coatroom, he    sees them in intimate conversation, leaning close to one    another." )        The image is presented, pure and distinct as a letter: it is    the letter of what pains me. Precise, complete, definitive, it    leaves no room for me, down to the last finicky detail: I    am excluded from it as from the primal scene, which may    exist only insofar as it is framed within the contour of the    keyhole. Here then, at last, is the definition of the image,    of any image: that from which I am excluded. Contrary to    those puzzle drawings in which the hunter is secretly    figured in the confusion of the foliage, I am not in the    scene: the image is without a riddle.           2.    The image is peremptory, it always has the last    word; no knowledge can contradict it, "arrange" it, refine    it. Werther knows perfectly well that Charlotte is betrothed to Albert, and in fact only suffers vaguely from the    fact; but "his whole body shudders when Albert embraces    her slender waist." I know perfectly well that Charlotte    does not belong to me, says Werther's reason, but all the    same, Albert is stealing her from me, says the image which    is before his eyes.        3.       The images from which I am excluded are cruel,    yet sometimes I am caught up in the image (reversal).    Leaving the outdoor cafe where I must leave behind the    other with friend s, I see myself walking away alone,    shoulders bowed, down the empty street. I convert my    exclusion into an image. This im age, in which my absence    is reflected as in a mirror, is a sad image.           A romantic painting shows a heap of icy debris in a polar    light; no man, no object inhabits this desolate space; but for this very reason, provided I am suffering an amorous    sadness, this void requires that I fling myself into it; I    project myself there as a tiny figure, seated on a block of    ice, abandoned forever. ''I' m cold," the lover says, "let's    go back"; but there is no road, no way, the boat is    wrecked. There is a coldness particular to the lover, the    chilliness of the child (or of any young animal) that needs    maternal warmth.        4.       What wounds me are the forms of the relation, its    images; or rather, what others call form I experience as    force. The image - as the example for the obsessive - is    the thing itself. The lover is thus an artist; and his world is    in fact a world reversed, since in it each image is its own    end (nothing beyond the image).          The Unknowable         inconnaissable / unknowable           Efforts of the amorous subject to understand and       define the loved being "in itself," by some       standard of character type, psychological or       neurotic personality, independent of the particular       data of the amorous relation.        1. I am caught in this contradiction: on the one    hand, I believe I know the other better than anyone and       triumphantly assert my knowledge to the other ("I know       you - I'm the only one who really knows you!"); and on       the other hand, I am often struck by the obvious fact that       the other is impenetrable, intractable, not to be found; I       cannot open up the other, trace back the other's origins,       solve the riddle. Where does the other come from? Who is       the other? I wear myself out, I shall never know.           (Of everyone I had known, X was certainly the most       impenetrable. This was because you never knew anything       about his desire: isn't knowing someone precisely that knowing his desire? I knew everything, immediately, about       Y's desires, hence Y himself was obvious to me, and I was       inclined to love him no longer in a state of terror but       indulgently, the way a mother loves her child.)           Reversal: "I can't get to know you" means "I shall never       know what you really think of me." I cannot decipher you       because I do not know how you decipher me.           2.       To expend oneself, to bestir oneself for an impenetrable object is pure religion. To make the other into an       insoluble riddle on which my life depends is to consecrate       the other as a god; I shall never manage to solve the       question the other asks me, the lover is not Oedipus. Then       all that is left for me to do is to reverse my ignorance into       truth. It is not true that the more you love, the better you       understand; all that the action of love obtains from me is       merely this wisdom: that the other is not to be known; his       opacity is not the screen around a secret, but, instead, a       kind of evidence in which the game of reality and appearance is done away with. I am then seized with that exaltation of loving someone unknown, someone who will remain so forever: a mystic impulse: I know what I do not       know.        3.    Or again, instead of trying to define the other       ("What is he?"), I turn to myself: "What do I want,       wanting to know you?" What would happen if I decided to       define you as a force and not as a person? And if I were to       situate myself as another force confronting yours? This       would happen: my other would be defined solely by the       suffering or the pleasure he affords me.          "Show me whom       to desire"         induction / induction           The loved being is desired because another or       others have shown the subject that such a being is       desirable: however particular, amorous desire is       discovered by induction.        1.       Shortly before falling in love, Werther meets a    young footman who tells him of his passion for a widow:    "The image of that fidelity, that tenderness, pursues me    everywhere, and as though scorched myself by that fire, I    faint, I fail, consuming myself." After which there is nothing left for Werther to do but to fall in love in his turn,    with Charlotte. And Charlotte herself will be pointed out    to him, before he sees her; in the carriage taking them to    the ball, an obliging friend tells him how lovely she is. The    body which will be loved is in advance selected and manipulated by the lens, subjected to a kind of zoom effect    which magnifies it, brings it closer, and leads the subject to    press his nose to the glass: is it not the scintillating object    which a skillful hand causes to shimmer before me and    which will hypnotize me, capture me? This "affective contagion," this induction, proceeds from others, from the    language, from books, from friends: no love is original.    (Mass culture is a machine for showing desire: here is    what must interest you, it says, as if it guessed that men    Stendhal    are incapable of finding what to desire by themselves.)           The difficulty of the amorous project is in this: "Just    show me whom to desire, but then get out of the way!":    Countless episodes in which I fall in love with someone    loved by my best friend: every rival has first been a    master, a guide, a barker, a mediator.           2.       In order to show you where your desire is, it is    enough to forbid it to you a little (if it is true that there is    no desire without prohibition). X wants me to be there,    beside him, while leaving him free a little: flexible, going    away occasionally, but not far: on the one hand, I must be    present as a prohibition (without which there would not    be the right desire), but also I must go away the moment    when, this desire having formed, I might be in its way: I    must be the Mother who loves enough (protective and    generous), around whom the child plays, while she peacefully knits or sews. This would be the structure of the    "successful" couple: a little prohibition, a good deal of    play; to designate desire and then to leave it alone, like    those obliging natives who show you the path but don't    insist on accompanying you on your way.       The Informer      informateur / informer        A friendly figure whose constant role, however,    seems to be to wound the amorous subject by    "innocently" furnishing commonplace information    about the loved being, though the effect of this    information is to disturb the subject's image of    that being.        1.    Gustave, Leon, and Richard form a group;       Urbain, Claudius, Etienne, and Ursule, another; Abel,       Gontran, Angele, and Hubert, still another (I borrow these    names from Paludes, which is the book of First Names).       However, Leon happens to meet Urbain, who gets to       know Angele, who knew Leon slightly anyway, etc. Thus       is formed a constellation; each subject is called upon to       enter into relations, one day or another, with the star remotest from him and to become involved with that particular star out of all the rest: everything ends by coinciding       (this is the precise impulse of A la recherche du temps       perdu, which is, among other things, a tremendous intrigue, a farce network). Worldly friendship is epidemic:       everyone catches it, like a disease. Now suppose that I       release into this network a suffering subject eager to maintain with his other a pure, sealed space (consecrated, untouched); the network's activities, its exchange of information, its interests and initiatives will be received as so       many dangers. And in the center of this little society, at       once an ethnological village and a boulevard comedy,       parental structure and comic imbroglio, stands the Informer, who busies himself and tells everyone everything.    Ingenuous or perverse, the Informer has a negative role.    However anodyne the message he gives me (like a disease), he reduces my other to being merely another. I am    of course obliged to listen to him (I cannot in worldly    terms allow my vexation to be seen), but I strive to make    my listening fiat, indifferent, impervious.           2.       What I want is a little cosmos (with its own time,    its own logic) inhabited only by " the two of us." Everything from outside is a threat; either in the form of boredom (if I must live in a world from which the other is    absent), or in the form of injury (if that world supplies    me with an indiscreet discourse concerning the other).    By furnishing me insignificant information about the one I    love, the Informer discovers a secret for me. This secret is    not a deep one, but comes from outside: it is the other's    "outside" which was hidden from me. The curtain rises    the wrong way round - not on an intimate stage, but on    the crowded theater. Whatever it tells me, the information    is painful: a dull, ungrateful fragment of reality lands on    me. For the lover's delicacy, every fact has something    aggressive about it: a bit of "science," however commonplace, invades the Image-repertoire.       This can't go on         insupportable / unbearable           The sentiment of an accumulation of amorous       sufferings explodes in this cry: "This can't       go on... "           1.    At the novel's end, with a phrase which will precipitate Werther's suicide, Charlotte (who has her problems, too) finally remarks that "things cannot go on like       this." Werther might have said as much himself, and quite       early in the book, for it is proper to the amorous situation       to be immediately intolerable, once the magical amazement of the first encounter is past. A demon denies time,       change, growth, dialectic, and says at every moment: This       can't go on! Yet it goes on, it lasts, if not forever, at least       a long time. Thus amorous patience has as its motor its       own denial: it proceeds neither from a kind of waiting, an       expectation, nor from mastery or ruse, nor from courage:       it is an unhappiness which does not wear itself out in       proportion to its acuity; a succession of jolts, the       (comic?) repetition of the gesture by which I signify to       myself that I have - courageously! - decided to put an end       to the repetition; the patience of an impatience.       (Reasonable sentiment: everything works out, but nothing       lasts. Amorous sentiment: nothing works out, but it keeps       going on. )        2.       To acknowledge the Unbearable: this cry has its       advantage: signifying to myself that I must escape by       whatever means, I establish within myself the martial       theater of Decision, of Action, of Outcome. Exaltation is       a kind of secondary profit from my impatience; I feed on       it, I wallow in it. Ever the "artist," I make form itself into       content. Imagining a painful outcome (renouncing, leaving, etc.), I intone, within myself, the exalted hallucination of closure; a vainglory of abnegation seizes me       (renouncing love but not friendship, etc.), and I immediately forget what I would then have to sacrifice: my       madness itself - which by its very status cannot be constituted as the object of my sacrifice: who ever saw a madman "sacrificing" his madness to someone? For the       moment, I regard abnegation as only a noble, theatrical       form; in other words, I still keep it within the enclosure of       my Image-repertoire.        3.    Once the exaltation has lapsed, I am reduced to       the simplest philosophy: that of endurance (the natural       dimension of real fatigues). I suffer without adjustment, I       persist without intensity: always bewildered, never discouraged; I am a Daruma doll, a legless toy endlessly       poked and pushed, but finally regaining its balance, assured by an inner balancing pin (But what is my balancing       pin? The force of love?). This is what we are told by a       folk poem which accompanies these Japanese dolls:           Such is life      Falling over seven times      And getting up eight.           Ideas of Solution         issues / outcomes           Enticement of solutions, whatever they may be,       which afford the amorous subject, despite their       frequently catastrophic character, a temporary       peace; hallucinatory manipulation of the possible       outcomes of the amorous crisis.        1. Idea of suicide; idea of separation; idea of with   drawal; idea of travel; idea of sacrifice, etc.; I can imagine       several solutions to the amorous crisis, and I keep doing       so. Yet, however alienated I may be, it is not difficult for       me to grasp, through all these recurrent notions, a single,       blank figure which is exclusively that of outcome; what I       live in such complicity with is the hallucination of another       role: the role of someone who "gets out."           Thus is revealed, once again, the language - nature of the       amorous sentiment: every solution is pitilessly referred to       its one and only idea - i.e., to a verbal being; so that,       finally, being language, the idea of outcome adjusts itself       to the foreclosure of any outcome: the lover's discourse is       in a sense a series of No Exits.        2.    The Idea is always a scene of pathos which I       imagine and by which I am moved; in short, a theater.       And it is the theatrical nature of the Idea from which I       benefit: this theater, of the stoic genre, magnifies me,       grants me stature. By imagining an extreme solution (i.e.,       a definitive one; i.e., a definite one), I produce a fiction, I       become an artist, I set a scene, I paint my exit; the Idea is    143       seen, like the pregnant moment (pregnant = endowed with       a strong, chosen meaning) of bourgeois drama: sometimes this is a farewell scene, sometimes a formal letter,       sometimes, for much later on, a dignified reencounter. The       art of the catastrophe calms me down.           3.    All the solutions I imagine are internal to the       amorous system: withdrawal, travel, suicide, it is always       the lover who sequesters himself, goes away, or dies; if he       sees himself sequestered, departed, or dead, what he sees       is always a lover: I order myself to be still in love and to       be no longer in love. This kind of identity of the problem       and its solution precisely defines the trap: I am trapped       because it lies outside my reach to change systems: I am       "done for" twice over: inside my own system and because I       cannot substitute another system for it. This double noose       apparently defines a certain type of madness (the trap       closes when the disaster is without contrary: "For there to    be a misfortune, the good itself must do harm"). Puzzle:       to "get out," I must get out of the system - which I want       to get out of, etc. If it were not in the "nature" of amorous       madness to pass, to cease of itself, no one could ever put       an end to it (it is not because he is dead that Werther has       stopped being in love, quite the contrary).    Jealousy      jalousie / jealousy        "A sentiment which is born in love and which is    produced by the fear that the loved person prefers    someone else" (Littre).           1. The jealous man in the novel is not Werther but    Herr Schmidt, Frederika's fiance, the bad-tempered man.    Werther's jealousy derives from images (seeing Albert slip    his arm around Charlotte's waist), not from thought. This    is because what is involved (and here is one of the book's    beauties) is a tragic disposition, not a psychological one.    Werther does not hate Albert; quite simply, Albert occupies a desired place: he is an adversary (a rival), not an    enemy: he is not "odious." In his letters to Wilhelm,    Werther shows himself to be anything but jealous. It is    only when confidence is exchanged for the final narrative    that the rivalry becomes acute, acrimonious, as if jealousy    appeared in this simple transition from I to he, from an    imaginary discourse (saturated by the other) to a discourse of the Other - of which Narrative is the statutory    voice.           The Proustian narrator has little relation to Werther. Is he    even a lover? He is merely jealous; in him, nothing    "lunar" - except when he loves, in the fashion of a lover,    the Mother (his grandmother).    2.    Werther is captured by this image: Charlotte cutting bread-and-butter and distributing the slices to her    brothers and sisters. Charlotte is a cake, and this cake is    divided up: each has his slice: I am not the only one - I    am alone in nothing, I have brothers, sisters, I am to    share, I must yield to the law of division: are not the    goddesses of Destiny also the goddesses of the human Lot,    of allotment - the Moirai, the last of whom is the Silent    One, Death? Further, if I do not accept the partitioning    out of love, I deny love's perfection, for it is proper to    perfection to be shared: Melitta is shared because she is    perfect, and Hyperion suffers from the fact: "My misery    was truly limitless. I was forced to withdraw." Thus I    suffer twice over: from the division itself, and from my    incapacity to endure its nobility.           3.    "When I love, I am very exclusive," Freud says    (whom we shall take here for the paragon of normality).    To be jealous is to conform. To reject jealousy ("to be    perfect" ) is therefore to transgress a law. Zuleika has tried    to seduce Joseph, and her husband is not distressed by her    doing so; this scandal requires an explanation: the scene    takes place in Egypt and Egypt is under a zodiacal sign    which excludes jealousy: Gemini.        (Inverted conform ism: one is no longer jealous, one condemns exclusivity, one lives with several lovers, etc.though consider what is actually the case here: suppose I    were forcing myself not to be jealous any longer, because I    was ashamed to be jealous? Jealousy is ugly, is bourgeois:    it is an unworthy fuss, a zeal - and it is this zeal which I    reject. )        4.    As a jealous man, I suffer four times over: because    I am jealous, because I blame myself for being so, because    I fear that my jealousy will wound the other, because I    allow myself to be subject to a banality: I suffer from    being excluded, from being aggressive, from being crazy,    and from being common.       I Love You      je-t'-aime / I-love-you        The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to    the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the    love cry.        1. Once the first avowal has been made, "I love you"       has no meaning whatever; it merely repeats in an enigmatic mode - so blank does it appear - the old message       (which may not have been transmitted in these words). I       repeat it exclusive of any pertinence; it comes out of the       language, it divagates - where?           I could not decompose the expression without laughing.       Then there would be "me" on one side, "you" on the       other, and in between a joint of reasonable (i.e., lexical)       affection. Anyone can feel how much such a decomposition, though conforming to linguistic theory, would disfigure what is flung out in a single impulse. To love does       not exist in the infinitive (except by a metalinguistic       artifice): the subject and the object come to the word even       as it is uttered, and I-love-you must be understood (and       read here) in the Hungarian fashion, for instance, for       Hungarian uses a single word, szeretlek, as if French,    renouncing its splendid analytical quality, were an agglutinative language (and it is, indeed, agglutination which is       in question here). This clump is shattered by the slightest       syntactical alteration; it is, so to speak, beyond syntax and       yields itself to no structural transformation; it has no       equivalent among its substitutes, whose combination       might nonetheless produce the same meaning; I can say I-love-you for days on end without perhaps ever being able    to proceed to "I love her": I resist making the other pass    through a syntax, a predication, a language (the sole Assumption of I-love-you is to apostrophize it, to give it the    expansion of a first name: Ariadne, I love you, Dionysus    says).        2.    I-love-you has no usages. Like a child's word, it    enters into no social constraint; it can be a sublime,    solemn, trivial word, it can be an erotic, pornographic    word. It is a socially irresponsible word.           I-love-you is without nuance. It suppresses explanations,    adjustments, degrees, scruples. In a way - exorbitant    paradox of language - to say I-love-you is to proceed as if    there were no theater of speech, and this word is always    true (has no other referent than its utterance: it is a performative).           I-love-you has no "elsewhere" - it is the word of the    (maternal, amorous) dyad; in it, no distance, no distortion will split the sign; it is the metaphor of nothing else.           I-love-you is not a sentence: it does not transmit a meaning, but fastens onto a limit situation: "the one where the    subject is suspended in a specular relation to the other." It    is a holophrase.           (Though spoken billions of times, I-love-you is extra-lexicographical; it is a figure whose definition cannot    transcend the heading.)        3.    The word (the word-as-sentence) has a meaning    only at the moment I utter it; there is no other information    in it but its immediate saying: no reservoir, no armory of       meaning. Everything is in the speaking of it: it is a       "formula," but this formula corresponds to no ritual; the       situations in which I say I-love-you cannot be classified: I-love-you is irrepressible and unforeseeable Then to what       linguistic order does this odd being, this linguistic feint,       belong, too articulated to be no more than an impulse, too       phatic to be a sentence? It is neither quite what is uttered       (no message is congealed, sorted, mummified within it,       ready for dissection) nor quite the uttering itself (the subject does not allow himself to be intimidated by the play of       interlocutory sites). We might call it a proffering, which       has no scientific place: I-love-you belongs neither in the       realm of linguistics nor in that of semiology. Its occasion       (the point of departure for speaking it) would be, rather,       Music. In the manner of what happens in singing, in the       proffering of I-love-you, desire is neither repressed (as in       what is uttered) nor recognized (where we did not expect       it: as in the uttering itself) but simply: released, as an       orgasm. Orgasm is not spoken, but it speaks and it says: I-love-you.        4.    To I-love-you there are various mundane       answers: "I don't love you," "I don't believe a word,"       "Why do you have to say so?," etc. But the true dismissal       is: "There is no answer": I am wiped out more completely       if I am rejected not only as the one who demands but also       as the speaking subject (as such, I have at least the       mastery of the formulas); it is my language, the last resort       of my existence, which is denied, not my demand; as for       the demand, I can wait, make it again, present it later; but       denied the power of questioning, I am "dead," forever.       "There is no answer," the Mother makes Francoise say to       the young Proustian narrator, who then correctly identifies       Proust       himself with the "mistress" sent away by her lover's concierge: the Mother is not forbidden, she is foreclosed and       I go mad.           5.       I love you. - So do I.           So do I is not a perfect answer, for what is perfect can       only be formal, and the form here is deficient, in that it       does not literally take up the proffering - and it is proper       to the proffering to be literal. However, insofar as it is       assimilated into the subject's hallucination, this reply is       enough to set going a whole discourse of jubilation: jubilation all the more powerful in that it wells up by means of       a sudden transformation: Saint-Preux discovers abruptly,       after several haughty denials, that Julie loves him. This is       the delirious truth which does not come by reasoning, by       any slow preparation, but by surprise, awakening (satori),       conversion. The Proustian child - asking that his mother       sleep in his room - wants to obtain the So-do-I: wants to       deliriously, in the fashion of a madman; and he, too, obtains it by a reversal, by the Father's capricious decision,       conceding him the Mother ("Tell Francoise to make up       your bed in his room, then, and sleep there tonight").        6.    I hallucinate what is empirically impossible: that       6.       our two profferings be made at the same time: that one       does not follow the other, as if it depended on it. Proffering cannot be double (doubled): only the single flash will       do, in which two forces join (separate, divided, they       would not exceed some ordinary agreement). For the       single flash achieves this unheard-of thing: the abolition of       Baudelaire       all responsibility. Exchange, gift, and theft (the only       Klossowski       known forms of economy) each in its way implies heterogeneous objects and a dislocated time: my desire against       something else - and this always requires the time for       drawing up the agreement. Simultaneous proffering establishes a movement whose model is socially unknown, unthinkable: neither exchange, nor gift, nor theft, our       proffering, welling up in crossed fires, designates an expenditure which relapses nowhere and whose very community abolishes any thought of reservation: we enter       each by means of the other into absolute materialism.           7.    So-do-I inaugurates a mutation: the old rules fall       away, everything is possible - even, then, this: that I give       up possessing you.           A revolution, in short - not so far, perhaps, from the political kind: for, in both cases, what I hallucinate is the       absolute New: (amorous) reform has no appeal for me.       And, to cap the paradox, this pure New is ultimately the       most worn-down of stereotypes (just last night, I heard it       uttered in a play by Sagan: every other night, on TV,       someone says: I love you).        8.    - And what if I didn't interpret I-love-you? What if I maintained the proffering on this side of the symptom?       - You take your chances: haven't you said hundreds of       times how intolerable the lover's suffering is, and his       necessity to get out of it? If you want to "recover," you       have to believe in the symptoms, and believe that I-love-you is one of them; you have to interpret, i.e., ultimately       you have to disparage.       - Then what do we have to think of suffering? How do we    have to conceive it? evaluate it? Is suffering necessarily on    the side of evil? Doesn't suffering in love have to do only    with a reactive, disparaging treatment (one must submit to    the prohibition)? Can one, reversing the evaluation,    imagine a tragic view of love's suffering, a tragic affirmation of I-love-you? And if (amorous) love were put (put    back) under the sign of the Active?        9.    Whence a new view of I-love-you. Not as a symptom but as an action. I speak so that you may answer, and    the scrupulous form (the letter) of the answer will assume    an effective value, in the manner of a formula. Hence it is    not enough that the other should answer me with a mere    signified, however positive ("So do I"): the addressed    subject must take the responsibility of formulating, of    proffering the I-love-you which I extend: I love you,    Pelleas says. - I love you, too, Melisande says.        Pelleas's imperious suit (supposing that Melisande's    answer was exactly the one he expected, which is probable    since he dies immediately afterwards) proceeds from the    necessity, for the amorous subject, not only to be loved in    return, to know it, to be sure of it, etc. (all operations    which do not exceed the level of the signified), but to hear    it said in the form which is as affirmative, as complete, as    articulated as his own; what I want is to receive full in the    face, entirely, literally, without evasion or leakage, the    formula, the archetype of love's word: no syntactical subterfuge, no variation: that the two phrases, the two words,    should correspond totally, coinciding signifier by signifier    (So do I would be just the contrary of a holophrase);    what matters is the physical, bodily, labial proffering of    the word: open your lips and let it out (be obscene).           What I want, deliriously, is to obtain the word. Magical,       mythical? The Beast - held enchanted in his ugliness loves Beauty; Beauty, obviously, does not love the Beast,       but at the end, vanquished (unimportant by what; let us       say by the conversations she has with the Beast), she, too,       says the magic word: "Je vous aime, la Bete"; and immediately, through the sumptuous arpeggio of a harp, a       new subject appears. Is this story an archaic one? Then       here is another: a man suffers because his wife has left       him; he wants her to come back, he wants - specifically her to say I love you to him, and he, too, runs after the       words; finally she says it to him: whereupon he faints dead       away: a film made in 1975. And then, once again, the       myth: the Flying Dutchman wanders the earth in search of       the word; if he obtains it (by an oath of fidelity), he will       cease wandering (what matters to the myth is not the rule       of fidelity but its proffering, its song).           10.       Singular encounter (within the German language): one and the same word (Bejahung) for two       affirmations: one, seized upon by psychoanalysis, is       doomed to disparagement (the child's first affirmation       must be denied so that there may be access to the unconscious); the other, posited by Nietzsche, is a mode of the       will-to-power (nothing psychological, and even less of the       social in it), the production of difference, the yes of this       affirmation becomes innocent (it contains the reaction formation): this is the amen.           I-love-you is active. It affirms itself as force - against       other forces. Which ones? The thousand force s of the       world, which are, all of them, disparaging forces (science,       doxa, reality, reason, etc.). Or again: against language.       Just as the am en is at the limit of language, without collusion with its system, stripping it of its "reactive mantle,"    so the proffering of love (I-love-you) stands at the limit of    syntax, welcomes tautology (I-love-you means I-love-you), rejects the servility of the Sentence (it is merely a    holophrase). As proffering, I-love-you is not a sign, but    plays against the signs. The one who does not say I-love-you (between whose lips I-love-you is reluctant to pass) is    condemned to emit the many uncertain, doubting, greedy    signs of love, its indices, its "proofs": gestures, looks,    sighs, allusions, ellipses: he must let himself be interpreted; he is dominated by the reactive occasion of love's    signs, exiled into the servile world of language in that he does not say everything (the slave is one who has his    tongue cut off, who can speak only by looks, expressions,    faces).        The "signs" of love feed an enormous reactive literature:    love is represented, entrusted to an aesthetic of appearances (it is Apollo, ultimately, who writes every love    story). As a counter-sign, I-love-you is on the side of    Dionysus: suffering is not denied (nor even complaint,    disgust, resentment), but by its proffering, it is not internalized: to say I-love-you (to repeat it) is to expel the    reaction-formation, to return it to the deaf and doleful    world of signs - of the detours of speech (which, however,    I never cease to pass through). As proffering, I-love-you is    on the side of expenditure. Those who seek the proffering    of the word (lyric poets, liars, wanderers) are subjects of    Expenditure: they spend the word, as if it were impertinent (base) that it be recovered somewhere; they are at    the extreme limit of language, where language itself (and    who else would do so in its place?) recognizes that it is    without backing or guarantee, working without a net.       Love's Languor         langueur / languor           Subtle state of amorous desire, experienced in its       dearth, outside of any will-to-possess.        1.    The Satyr says: I want my desire to be satisfied    immediately. If I see a sleeping face, parted lips, an open    hand, I want to be able to hurl myself upon them. This    Satyr - figure of the Immediate - is the very contrary of    the Languorous. In languor, I merely wait: "I knew no    end to desiring you." (Desire is everywhere, but in the    amorous state it becomes something very special:    languor.)           2.       "and you tell me my other self will you answer me    at last I am tired of you I want you I dream of you for you    against you answer me your name is a perfume about me    your color bursts among the thorns bring back my heart    with cool wine make me a coverlet of the morning I    suffocate beneath th is mask withered shrunken skin nothing exists save desire"           3.    "... for when I glance at you even an instant, I    can no longer utter a word: my tongue thickens to a lump,    and beneath my skin breaks out a subtle fire: my eyes are    blind, my ears filled with humming, and sweat streams    down my body, I am seized by a sudden shuddering; I turn    greener than grass, and in a moment more, I feel I shall    die."        4.       "My soul, when I embraced Agathon, came to my    lips, as if the wretch would leave me and go elsewhere." In    amorous languor, something keeps going away; it is as if desire were nothing but this hemorrhage. Such is amorous    fatigue: a hunger not to be satisfied, a gaping love. Or    again: my entire self is drawn, transferred to the loved    object which takes its place: languor would be that exhausting transition from narcissistic libido to object libido.    (Desire for the absent being and desire for the present    being: languor superimposes the two desires, putting absence within presence. Whence a state of contradiction:    this is the "gentle fire.")       The Love Letter      lettre / letter        This figure refers to the special dialectic of the    love letter, both blank (encoded) and expressive    (charged with longing to signify desire).        1.       When Werther (in the Ambassador's employ)    writes to Charlotte, his letter follows this outline: 1. What    joy to be thinking of you! 2. Here I am in a mundane    situation, and without you I feel utterly alone. 3. I have    met someone (Fraulein von B... ) who resembles    you and with whom I can speak of you. 4. I keep hoping    that we can be reunited. - A single piece of information is    varied, in the manner of a musical theme: I am thinking    of you.        What does "thinking of you" mean? It means: forgetting    "you" (without forgetting, life itself is not possible) and    frequently waking out of that forgetfulness. Many things, by association, bring you back into my discourse. "Thinking of you" means precisely this metonymy. For, in itself,    such thinking is blank: I do not think you; I simply make    you recur (to the very degree that I forget you). It is this    form (this rhythm) which I call "thought": I have nothing    to tell you, save that it is to you that I tell this nothing:           Why do I turn once again to writing?     Beloved, you must not ask such a question,      For the truth is, I have nothing to tell you,      All the same, your dear hands will hold this note.       ("Think of Hubert, writes the narrator of Paludes, that    Gide       Book of Nothing, on his engagement calendar, comically       enough.)        2.       "As you see," writes the Marquise de Merteuil,       "when you write someone, it is for that person and not for       yourself, so you must be sure not to say what you think,       but rather what will please that person." The Marquise is       not in love; what she postulates is a correspondence, i.e., a       tactical enterprise to defend positions, make conquests;    this enterprise must reconnoiter the positions (the subgroups) of the adverse group, i.e., must articulate the       other's image in various points which the letter will try to       touch (in this sense, "correspondence" is precisely the       word to use, in its mathematical sense). But for the lover       the letter has no tactical value: it is purely expressive - at       most, flattering (but here flattery is not a matter of self interest, merely the language of devotion); what I engage       in with the other is a relation, not a correspondence: the       relation brings together two images. You are everywhere,       your image is total, Werther writes to Charlotte, in various       ways.           3.    Like desire, the love letter waits for an answer; it       implicitly enjoins the other to reply, for without a reply       the other's image changes, becomes other. This is what the       young Freud explai ns so authoritatively to his fiancee:       "Yet I don't want my letters to keep remaining unanswered, and I shall stop writing you altogether if you don't    write back. Perpetual monologues apropos of a loved       being, which are neither corrected nor nourished by that       being, lead to erroneous notions concerning mutual relations, and make us strangers to each other when we meet       again, so that we find things different from what, without       realizing it, we imagined."           (The one who would accept the "injustices" of communication, the one who would continue speaking lightly,       tenderly, without being answered, would acquire a great       mastery: the mastery of the Mother.)           The Loquela      loquela        This word, borrowed from Ignatius of Loyola,    designates the flux of language through which the    subject tirelessly rehashes the effects of a wound or    the consequences of an action: an emphatic form    of the lover's discourse.        1.       Trop penser me font amours - love makes me    think too much. At times, result of some infinitesimal    stimulus, a fever of language overcomes me, a parade of    reasons, interpretations, pronouncements. I am aware of    nothing but a machine running all by itself, a hurdy-gurdy    whose crank is turned by a staggering but anonymous bystander, and which is never silent. In the loquela, nothing    ever manages to prevent these repetitions. Once I happen    to produce a "successful" phrase in my mind (imagining I    have found the right expression for some truth or other),    it becomes a formula I repeat in proportion to the relief it    affords (finding the right word is euphoric); I chew it    over, feeding on it; like children or the victims of    merycism, I keep swallowing and regurgitating my wound.    I spin, unwind and weave the lover's case, and begin all    over again (these are the meanings of the verb meruomai: to spin, to unwind, to weave).        Or again: the autistic child frequently watches his own    fingers touching objects (but does not watch the objects    themselves): this is twiddling, which is not a form of play       but a ritual manipulation, marked by stereotyped and       compulsive features. As with the lover suffering from the       loquela: he twiddles his wound.           2. Humboldt calls the sign's freedom volubility. I am    (inwardly) voluble, because I cannot anchor my discourse: the signs turn "in free wheeling." If I could constrain the sign, submit it to some sanction, I could find rest       at last. If only we could put our minds in plaster casts, like       our legs! But I cannot keep from thinking, from speaking;       no director is there to interrupt the interior movie I keep       making of myself, someone to shout, Cut! Volubility is a       kind of specifically human misery: I am language-mad: no       one listens to me, no one looks at me, but (like Schubert's       organ-grinder) I go on talking, turning my hurdy-gurdy.       I take a role: I am the one who is going to cry;           3.       and I play this role for myself, and it makes me cry: I am       my own theater. And seeing me cry this way makes me cry       all the more; and if the tears tend to decrease, I quickly       repeat to myself the lacerating phrase that will set them       flowing again. I have two speakers in myself, busy raising       the tone, from one utterance to the next, as in the old       stichomythias: there is a bliss in doubled, in redoubled       speech, taken to the final din (the clown scene).          The Last Leaf         magie / magic        Magic consultations, secret rites, and votive    actions are not absent from the amorous subject's    life, whatever culture he belongs to.           1.    "Here and there, on the trees, some leaves remain.       And I often stand deep in thought before them. I contemplate a leaf and attach my hope to it. When the wind plays       with the leaf, I tremble in every limb. And if it should fall,       alas, my hope falls with it."           In order to be able to question fate, there must be an       alternative: she loves me / she loves me not; we require       an object capable of a simple variation (will fall / won't       fall) and an external force (divinity, chance, wind) which       marks one of the poles of the variation. I always ask the       same question (will I be loved?), and this question is an       alternative: all or nothing; I do not suppose that things       can develop, be exempted from desire's a propos. I am not       dialectical. Dialectic would say: the leaf will not fall, and       then it will fall; but meanwhile you will have changed and       you will no longer ask yourself the question.           (From any consultant whatever, I expect the following:       "The person you love loves you as well, and will tell you       so tonight.")        2.    Sometimes the anxiety is so powerful and so pressing (since that is the word's etymology) - an anxiety of    waiting, for instance - that it becomes necessary to do       something. This "something" is naturally (ancestrally) a       vow: if (you come back... ), then (I will fulfill my       vow).        X confides: "The first time; he lit a candle in a little       Italian church. He was surprised by the flame 's beauty,       and the action seemed less absurd. Why henceforth deprive himself of the pleasure of creating a light? So he       began again, attaching to this delicate gesture (tilting the       new candle toward the one already lit, gently rubbing their       wicks, taking pleasure when the fire 'took,' filling his eyes       with that intimate yet brilliant light) ever vaguer vows       which were to include - for fear of choosing - 'everything       which fails in the world.'       "I am odious"         monstreux / monstrous           The subject suddenly realizes that he is       imprisoning the loved object in a net of tyrannies:       he has been pitiable, now he becomes monstrous.        1.       In Plato's Phaedrus, the speeches of Lysias the       Sophist and of the early Socrates (before the latter makes       his recantation) rest on this principle: that the lover is       intolerable (by his heaviness ) to the beloved. There follows the catalogue of importunate features: the lover cannot bear anyone to be superior or equal to himself in his       beloved's eyes, and strives to defeat every rival; he keeps       the beloved apart from a host of relationships; he attempts, by a thousand indelicate schemes, to keep the beloved in ignorance, so that he will know only what comes       to him from his lover; he secretly craves the loss of what is       dearest to the beloved: father, mother, relatives, friends;       he wants the beloved to have neither home nor children;       his daily assiduity is wearisome; he is not content to be       left alone for a minute, day or night; though old (which in       itself is importunate), he acts as a tyrannical detective and       constantly subjects the beloved to malicious spying, while       he himself subjects himself to no such prohibitions, later       on, as to infidelity and ingratitude. Whatever he supposes,       the lover's heart is filled with bad feelings: his love is not       generous.        2.    The lover's discourse stifles the other, who finds no       place for his own language beneath this massive utterance.       It is not that I keep the other from speaking; but I know       how to make the pronouns skid: "I speak and you hear       me, hence we exist" (Ponge). Sometimes, in terror, I become aware of this reversal: I who supposed myself to be       pure subject (subjected subject: fragile, delicate, pitiable)       find myself turned into an obtuse thing blindly moving       onward, crushing everything beneath his discourse; I who       love am undesirable, consigned to the category of the       bores: the ones who bear down too hard, who irritate,       encroach, complicate, demand, intimidate (or more       simply: those who speak). I have monumentally deceived       myself.        (The other is disfigured by his persistent silence, as in       those terrible dreams in which a loved person shows up       with the lower part of his face quite erased, without any       mouth at all; and I, the one who speaks, I too am disfigured: soliloquy makes me into a monster: one huge       tongue.           No Answer         mutisme / silence           1. The amorous subject suffers anxiety because the       loved object replies scantily or not at all to his       language (discourse or letters). "When you were talking to him, discussing any       subject at all, X frequently seemed to be looking away,       listening to something else: you broke off, discouraged;       after a long silence, X would say: 'Go on, I'm listening to       you'; then you resumed as best you could the thread of a       story in which you no longer believed."        (Like a bad concert hall, affective space contains dead       spots where the sound fails to circulate. - The perfect       interlocutor, the friend, is he not the one who constructs       around you the greatest possible resonance? Cannot       friendship be defined as a space with total sonority?)        2.    This evasive listening, which I can capture only       after some delay, involves me in a sordid calculation:       desperately trying to seduce, to divert, I imagined that by       talking I was lavishing treasures of ingenuity, but these       treasures have produced only indifference; I am spending       my "qualities" for nothing: a whole program of affects,       doctrines, awareness, and delicacy, all the brilliance my       ego can command dies away, muffled in an inert space, as       if - culpable thought - my quality exceeded that of the       loved object, as if I were in advance of that object. Now,       the affective relation is an exact machine; coincidence,       perfect pitch in the musical sense are fundamental to it;       what is out of phase is immediately de trap: my language       is not, strictly speaking, a discard but rather an "overstock": what is not consumed in the moment (in the       movement) and is therefore remaindered.        (This distracted kind of listening generates an anxiety of       decisions: should I continue, go on talking "in the void"?       This would require precisely the assurance which amorous       sensibility does not permit. Should I stop, give up? This       would seem to show anger, accusation of the other, producing a "scene." The trap all over again.)        3.       "This is what death is, most of all: everything that       has been seen, will have been seen for nothing. Mourning       over what we have perceived." In those brief moments       when I speak for nothing, it is as if I were dying. For the       loved being becomes a leaden figure, a dream creature    who does not speak, and silence, in dreams, is death. Or       again: the gratifying Mother shows me the Mirror, the       Image, and says to me: "That's you." But the silent       Mother does not tell me what I am: I am no longer established, I drift painfully, without existence.          Clouds         nuages / clouds        Meaning and employment of that darkening of    mood which overtakes the subject under various    circumstances.        1. Werther is kind to Frederika, the daughter of the pastor of St *** to whom he and Charlotte pay a visit.    The face of Herr Schmidt, Frederika's fiance, darkens    accordingly; he refuses to take part in the conversation.    Werther then expatiates on bad humor; it stems from our    jealousy, our vanity, it is a discontent with ourselves    which we project onto others, etc. "Show me the man,    Werther says, who has the honesty and the honor to conceal his bad humor, to endure it in solitude, without destroying the pleasure of those around him!" Such a man is    obviously not to be found, for bad humor is nothing more    or less than a message. Unable to be obviously jealous    without certain disadvantages, among which absurdity, I    shift my jealousy, I produce only a derived, a distorted,    indeed an incomplete effect, whose actual motive is not    openly spoken: incapable of concealing the wound and    not daring to declare its cause, I compromise; I botch the    content without renouncing the form; the result of this    transaction is temper, which offers itself to a reading like    the index of a sign: here you should read (that something    is awry): I simply lay my pathos down on the table, reserving to myself the right to unwrap the package later,    depending on the circumstances: either I reveal myself (in    the course of an "explanation"), or else I swathe myself       170    still further (such moods are a short circuit between the state and the sign). (Misreading: Werther attacks bad    humor in that it weighs on those around you; yet, later on,    he himself will commit suicide, surely a heavier burden. Is    a love suicide perhaps an exacerbated temper, a kind of    tantrum?)        2.       So much for bad humor: a crude sign, a shameful    blackmail. Yet there are subtler clouds, all the tenuous    shadows of swift and uncertain source which pass across    the relationship, changing its light and its modeling; suddenly it is another landscape, a faint black intoxication.    The cloud, then, is no more than this: I'm missing something. Summarily I inventory the states of dearth by which    Zen has encoded human sensibility (furyu): solitude    (sabi), the sadness which overcomes me because of the    "incredible naturalness" of things (wabi), nostalgia    (aware), the sentiment of strangeness (yugen). "I am    happy but I am sad": such was Melisande's "cloud."    "And the night    illuminated the night"      nuit / night        Any state which provokes in the subject the    metaphor of the darkness, whether affective,    intellective, or existential, in which he struggles    or subsides.        1. I experience alternately two nights, one good, the other bad. To express this, I borrow a mystical distinction: estar a oscuras (to be in the dark) can occur without    John of    the Cross       there being any blame to attach, since I am deprived of       the light of causes and effects; estar en tinieblas (to be in       the shadows: tenebrae) happens to me when I am blinded       by attachment to things and the disorder which emanates       from that condition.           Most often I am in the very darkness of my desire; I know       not what it wants, good itself is an evil to me, everything       resounds, I live between blows, my head ringing: estoy en       tinieblas. But sometimes, too, it is another Night: alone,       in a posture of meditation (perhaps a role I assign myself?), I think quite calmly about the other, as the other is;       I suspend any interpretation; I enter into the night of nonmeaning; desire continues to vibrate (the darkness is       transluminous), but there is nothing I want to grasp; this       is the Night of non-profit, of subtle, invisible expenditure:       estoy a oscuras: I am here, sitting simply and calmly in the       dark interior of love.        2.    The second night envelops the first, the Darkness    illuminates the Shadows: "And the night was dark and it    illuminated the night." I make no attempt to emerge from    the amorous impasse by Decision, Enterprise, Separation,    Sacrifice, etc.; in short, by gesture. I merely substitute one    night for the other. "To darken this darkness, this is the    gate of all wonder."          The Ribbon         objets / objects        Every object touched by the loved being's body    becomes part of that body, and the subject eagerly    attaches himself to it.        1.       Werther multiplies the gestures of fetishism: he    kisses the knot of ribbon Charlotte has given him for his    birthday, the letter she sends him (even putting the sand    to his lips), the pistols she has touched. From the loved    being emanates a power nothing can stop and which will    impregnate everything it comes in contact with, even if    only by a glance: if Werther, unable to go see Charlotte,    sends her his servant, it is this servant himself upon whom    her eyes have rested who becomes for Werther a part of    Charlotte ("I would have taken his head between my    hand s and kissed him then and there, had not human respect prevented me"). Each object thus consecrated    (placed within the influence of the god) becomes like the    stone of Bologna, which by night gives off the rays it has    accumulated during the day.        (He puts the Phallus in place of the Mother - identifies    himself with it. Werther wants to be buried with the ribbon Charlotte has given him; in the grave, he lies alongside the Mother - then specifically evoked.)        Sometimes the metonymic object is a presence (engendering joy); sometimes it is an absence (engendering distress). What does my reading of it depend on? - If I    believe myself about to be gratified, the object will be    favorable; if 1 see myself as abandoned, it will be sinister.        2.       Aside from these fetishes, there is no other object    in the amorous world. It is a world sensuously impoverished, abstract, erased, canceled out; my gaze passes    through things without acknowledging their seduction; I       am dead to all sensuality except that of the "charming       body." Of the external world, the only thing I can associate with my condition is the quality of the weather, as if    the day's character were a dimension of the Image-repertoire (the Image is neither profound nor colored, but       it is charged with all the nuances of light and warmth,       communicating with the amorous body, which thus feels       itself to be well or ill as a whole, as a communion). In the       code of the Japanese haiku, there must always be a word       haiku       which refers back to the time of day and of the year; this       is the kigo, the season-word. Amorous notation retains       the kigo, that faint allusion to the rain, to the evening, to       the light, to everything that envelops, diffuses.        Love's Obscenity  obscene / obscene        Discredited by modern opinion, love's    sentimentality must be assumed by the amorous    subject as a powerful transgression which leaves    him alone and exposed; by a reversal of values,    then, it is this sentimentality which today    constitutes love's obscenity.           1.       Example of obscenity: each occasion in this very       text that the word "love" is used (the obscenity would       cease if we were to say, mockingly, " luv").           Or again: "Evening at the Opera: a very bad tenor comes       on stage; in order to express his love to the woman he       loves, who is beside him, he stands facing the pUblic. I am       this tenor: like a huge animal, obscene and stupid,       brightly lighted as in a show window, I declaim an elaborately encoded aria, without looking at the one I love, to       whom I am supposed to be addressing myself."           Or again: a dream: I am giving a course "on" love; my       students are all women, no longer young: I am Paul       Geraldy.           Or again: ".   ..   the word did not seem to him to repay       such frequent repetition. The slippery monosyllable, with       its lingual and labial, and the bleating vowel between - it       came to sound positively offensive; it suggested watered       milk, or anything else that was pale and insipid... "       Or finally: my love is "a sexual organ of unparalleled       sensitivity which trembles as it makes me utter terrible       cries, the cries of a huge but stinking ejaculation, at grips       Bataille       with the ecstatic gift that one makes of oneself as a naked,       obscene victim... mocked by the loud laughter of the       whores."        I take for myself the scorn lavished on any kind of pathos:       formerly, in the name of reason ("In order that so ardent       a production, Lessing said of Werther, not do more harm       than good, do you not suppose it required a brief, cool       peroration?"), today in the name of "modernity," which       acknowledges a subject, provided it be "generalized"       ("True popular music, the music of the masses, plebeian       music, is open to all the impulses of group subjectivities,       no longer to the solitary subjectivity, the highfalutin sentimental subjectivity of the isolated subject..." Daniel       Charles, "Musique et Dublin).        2.    Encounter with an intellectual in love: for him,       "to assume" (not to repress) extreme stupidity, the naked       stupidity of his discourse, is the same thing as for Bataille's       subject to take off his clothes in a public place: the       necessary form of the impossible and of the sovereign: an       abjection such that no discourse of transgression can       recuperate it and such that it exposes itself without protection to the moralism of anti-morality. From this point, he       judges his contemporaries as so many innocents: they are       innocent, those who censure amorous sentimentality in the       name of a new morality: "The distinctive mark of modern       souls is not lying but innocence, incarnate in lying       moralism. To discover this innocence everywhere - that       may be the most disheartening part of our task."       (Historical reversal: it is no longer the sexual which is       indecent, it is the sentimental - censured in the name of       what is in fact only another morality.)        3.       The lover raves (he "shifts the sentiment of       values"); but his raving is stupid. What is stupider than a       lover? So stupid that no one dares offer his discourse       publicly without a serious mediation: novel, play, or       analysis (between tweezers). Socrates's daimon (the one       who spoke first within him) whispered to him: no. My       daimon, on the contrary, is my stupidity: like the       Nietzschean ass, I say yes to everything, in the field of my       love. I insist, reject all training, repeat the same actions;       no one can educate me - nor can I educate myself; my       discourse is continuously without reflection; I do not know       how to reverse it, organize it, stud it with glances, quotation marks; I always speak in the first degree; I persist in a       dutiful, discreet, conformist delirium, tamed and banalized       by literature.        (What is stupid is to be surprised. The lover is constantly       so; he has no time to transform, to reverse, to protect.       Perhaps he knows his stupidity, but he do es not censure it.       Or again: his stupidity acts as a cleavage, a perversion:       it's stupid, he says, and yet... it's true.)           4.       Whatever is anachronic is obscene. As a (modern)       divinity, History is repressive, History forbids us to be out       of time. Of the past we tolerate only the ruin, the monument, kitsch, what is amusing: we reduce this past to no       more than its signature. The lover's sentiment is old-fashioned, but this antiquation cannot even be recuperated as       a spectacle: love falls outside of interesting time; no historical, polemical meaning can be given to it; it is in this       that it is obscene.           5.    In amorous life, the fabric of incidents is of an       incredible futility, and this futility, allied with the highest       seriousness, is literally unseemly. When I seriously       envisage committing suicide because of a telephone call       that doesn't come, an obscenity occurs which is as great as       when, in Sade, the pope sodomizes a turkey. But senti   mental obscenity is less strange, and that is what makes it       more abject; nothing can exceed the unseemliness of a       subject who collapses in tears because his other behaves       distantly, "when there are still so many men in the world       who are dying of. hunger, when so many nations are       struggling for their freedom," etc.           6.    The moral tax levied by society on all transgressions affects passion still more than sex today. Everyone       will understand that X has "huge problems" with his sexuality; but no one will be interested in those Y may have       with his sentimentality: love is obscene precisely in that it       puts the sentimental in place of the sexual. That "sentimental old baby" (Fourier) who suddenly died while       deeply in love would seem as obscene as President Felix       Faure, who died of a stroke in his mistress's arms.        7.    Amorous obscenity is extreme: nothing can       redeem it, bestow upon it the positive value of a transgression; the subject's solitude is timid, stripped of any decor:       no Bataille will give a style (an ecriture) to that obscenity.       179       The amorous text (scarcely a text at all) consists of little       narcissisms, psychological paltrinesses; it is without       grandeur: or its grandeur (but who, socially, is present to       acknowledge it?) is to be unable to reach any grandeur,       not even that of "crass materialism." It is then the impossible moment when the obscene can really coincide with       affirmation, with the amen, the limit of language (any       utterable obscenity as such can no longer be the last degree of the obscene: uttering it, even through the wink of a       figure, I myself am already recuperated, socialized).           In Praise of Tears         pleurer / crying           The amorous subject has a particular propensity       to cry: the functioning and appearance of tears       in this subject.           1.    The slightest amorous emotion, whether of happiness or of disappointment, brings Werther to tears.       Werther weeps often, very often, and in floods. Is it the       lover in Werther who weeps, or is it the romantic?        Is it perhaps a disposition proper to the amorous type, this       propensity to dissolve in tears? Subjected to the Imagerepertoire, he flouts the censure which today forbids the       adult tears and by which a man means to protest his       virility (Piaf's satisfaction and maternal tenderness:       "Ma is vous pleurez, Milord!"). By releasing his tears       without constraint, he follows the orders of the amorous       body, which is a body in liquid expansion, a bathed body:       to weep together, to flow together: delicious tears finish       off the reading of Klopstock which Charlotte and Werther       perform together. Where does the lover obtain the right to       cry, if not in a reversal of values, of which the body is the       first target? He accepts rediscovering the infant body.        Further, here, the amorous body is doubled by a historical       Schubert       one. Who will write the history of tears? In which societies, in which periods, have we wept? Since when is it that       men (and not women) no longer cry? Why was "sensibility," at a certain moment, transformed into "sentimentality"? The images of virility are shifting; the Greeks as well       as our audiences of the seventeenth century cried a great       deal at the theater. St. Louis, according to Michelet,       suffered at not having received the gift of tears; on the one       occasion that he felt tears running gently down his face,       "they seemed to him delectable and comforting, not only       to the heart but to the tongue." (Similarly: in 1199, a       young monk set out for a Cistercian abbey in Brabant in       order to obtain, by the tears of its inmates, the gift of       tears.)        (A Nietzschean problem: How do History and Type combine? Is it not up to the type to formulate - to form - what       is out of time, ahistorical? In the lover's very tears, our       society represses its own timelessness, thereby turning the       weeping lover into a lost object whose repression is necessary to its "health." In Rohmer's film The Marquise of 0,       the lovers weep and the audience giggles.)        2.    Perhaps "weeping" is too crude; perhaps we must       not refer all tears to one and the same signification; perhaps within the same lover there are several subjects who       engage in neighboring but different modes of "weeping."       Which is that "I" who has "tears in my eyes"? Which is       that other self who, on a certain day, was "on the verge of       tears"? Who am I who pours out "all the tears in my       body"? or who sheds, upon waking, "a torrent of tears"?       If I have so many ways of crying, it may be because, when       I cry, I always address myself to someone, and because       the recipient of my tears is not always the same: I adapt       my ways of weeping to the kind of blackmail which, by       my tears, I mean to exercise around me.           3.       By weeping, I want to impress someone, to bring       pressure to bear upon someone ("Look what you have       done to me"). It can be - as is commonly the case - the       other whom one thus constrains to assume his commiseration or his insensibility quite openly; but it can also be       oneself: I make myself cry, in order to prove to myself       that my grief is not an illusion: tears are signs, not expressions. By my tears, I tell a story, I produce a myth of       grief, and henceforth I adjust myself to it: I can live with       it, because, by weeping, I give myself an emphatic interlocutor who receives the "truest" of messages, that of my       body, not that of my speech: "Words, what are they? One       tear will say more than all of them."          Gossip      potin /          gossip       Pain suffered by the amorous subject when he finds       that the loved being is the subject of "gossip" and       hears that being discussed promiscuously.        1.       On the road from Phalerum, a bored traveler    catches sight of another man walking ahead of him,    catches up and asks him to tell about the banquet given by Agathon. Such is the genesis of the theory of love: an    accident, boredom, a desire to talk, or, if you will, a gossip    lasting a little over a mile. Aristodemus has been to the    famous banquet; he has described it to Apollodorus, who,    on the road from Phalerum, tells the story of Glaucon (a    man, it is said, without any philosophic culture) and    thereby, by the book's mediation, tells it to us, who are    still discussing it. The Symposium is therefore not only a    "conversation" (we are discussing a question) but also a    gossip (we are speaking together about others).        This work derives, then, from two different linguistic    series, generally repressed - since official linguistics concerns itself only with the message. The first series would    postulate that no question (quaestio) can be put without    the texture of an interlocution; to speak of love, the guests    not only speak together, from image to image, from place     to place (in the Symposium, the arrangement of couches has a great importance), but further imply in his    general discourse the amorous links which bind them (or    which they imagine bind the others): such would be the    linguistics of "conversation. " The second series would say    that to speak is always to say something about someone;    in speaking about the banquet, about Love, it is about    Socrates, about Alcibiades, and about their friends that    Glaucon and Apollodorus are talking: the "subject"    comes to light by gossip. An active philology (that of the    forces of language) would therefore include two necessary    linguistic series: that of interlocution (speaking to another) and that of delocution (speaking about someone).           2.       Werther has not yet made Charlotte's acquaintance; but in the carriage taking him to the ball (which is    to pass Charlotte on the way), a friend - the voice of    Gossip - discusses for Werther's benefit the woman whose    image will in a few seconds so delight him: she is already    engaged, he must not fall in love with her, etc. Thus gossip    summarizes and heralds the story to come. Gossip is the    voice of truth (Werther will fall in love with an object    belonging to another), and this voice is magical: the    friend is a wicked fairy who, under cover of admonishment, predicts and enforces.        When the friend speaks, her discourse is insensitive (a    fairy has no pity): the gossip is light, cold, it thereby    assumes the status of a kind of objectivity; its voice, in    short, seems to double the voice of knowledge (scientia).    These two voices are reductive. When knowledge, when    science speaks, I sometimes come to the point of hearing    its discourse as the sound of a gossip which describes and    disparages lightly, coldly, and objectively what I love:    which speaks of what I love according to truth.        3.    Gossip reduces the other to he/ she, and this       reduction is intolerable to me. For me the other is neither       he nor she; the other has only a name of his own, and her       own name. The third-person pronoun is a wicked pronoun: it is the pronoun of the non-person, it absents, it       annuls. When I realize that common discourse takes possession of my other and restores that other to me in the       bloodless form of a universal substitute, applied to all the       things which are not here, it is as if I saw my other dead,       reduced, shelved in an urn upon the wall of the great       mausoleum of language. For me, the other cannot be a       referent: you are never anything but you, I do not want       the Other to speak of you.        Why?      pourquoi / why        Even as he obsessively asks himself why he is not    loved, the amorous subject lives in the belief that    the loved object does love him but does not tell    him so.        1.    There exists a "higher value" for me: my love. I    never say to myself: "What's the use?" I am not nihilistic.    I do not ask myself the question of ends. Never a "why"    in my monotonous discourse, except for one, always the    same: But why is it that you don't love me? How can one    not love this me whom love renders perfect (who gives so    much, who confers happiness, etc.)? A question whose    insistence survives the amorous episode: "Why didn't you    love me?"; or again: O sprich, mein herzallerliebstes    Lieb, warum verliessest du mich? - O tell, love of my    heart, why have you abandoned me?           2.       Soon (or simultaneously) the question is no longer    "Why don't you love me?" but "Why do you only love me    a little?" How do you manage to love a little? What does    that mean, loving "a little"? I live under the regime of too    much or not enough; greedy for coincidence as I am,    everything which is not total seems parsimonious; what I    want is to occupy a site from which quantities are no       longer perceived, and from which all accounts are       banished.       Or again - for I am a nominalist: Why don't you tell me       that you love me?           3.       The truth of the matter is that - by an exorbitant       paradox - I never stop believing that I am loved. I       hallucinate what I desire. Each wound proceeds less from       a doubt than from a betrayal: for only the one who loves       can betray, only the one who believes himself loved can be       jealous: that the other, episodically, should fail in his       being, which is to love me - that is the origin of all my       woes. A delirium, however, does not exist unless one       wakens from it (there are only retrospective deliriums):       one day, I realize what has happened to me: I thought I       was suffering from not being loved, and yet it is because I       thought I was loved that I was suffering; I lived in the       complication of supposing myself simultaneously loved       and abandoned. Anyone hearing my intimate language       would have had to exclaim, as of a difficult child: But       after all, what does he want?           (I love you becomes you love me. One day, X receives       some orchids, anonymously: he immediately hallucinates       their source: they could only come from the person who       loves him; and the person who loves him could only be the       person he loves. It is only after a long period of investigation that he manages to dissociate the two inferences: the       person who loves him is not necessarily the person he       loves.)          Ravishment         ravissement / ravishment           The supposedly initial episode (though it may be       reconstructed after the fact) during which the       amorous subject is "ravished" (captured and       enchanted) by the image of the loved object       (popular name: love at first sight; scholarly name:       enamoration).        1.    Language (vocabulary) has long since posited the    equivalence of love and war: in both cases, it is a matter    of conquering, ravishing, capturing, etc. Each time a subject "falls" in love, he revives a fragment of the archaic    time when men were supposed to carry off women (in    order to ensure exogamy): every lover who falls in love at    first sight has something of a Sabine Woman (or of some    other celebrated victim of ravishment).        However, there is an odd turnabout here: in the ancient    myth, the ravisher is active, he wants to seize his prey, he    is the subject of the rape (of which the object is a Woman,    as we know, invariably passive); in the modern myth       (that of love-as-passion), the contrary is the case: the    ravisher wants nothing, does nothing; he is motionless (as    any image), and it is the ravished object who is the real    subject of the rape; the object of capture becomes the    subject of love; and the subject of the conquest moves into    the class of loved object. (There nonetheless remains a    public vestige of the archaic model: the lover - the one    who has been ravished - is always implicitly feminized.)    This singular reversal may perhaps proceed from the fact    that for us the "subject" (since Christianity) is the one    who suffers: where there is a wound, there is a subject: die    Wunde! die Wunde! says Parsifal, thereby becoming    "himself"; and the deeper the wound, at the body's center    (at the "heart"), the more the subject becomes a subject:    for the subject is intimacy ( "The wound... is of a    frightful intimacy"). Such is love's wound: a radical    chasm (at the " roots" of being), which cannot be closed,    and out of which the subject drains, constituting himself as    a subject in this very draining. It would suffice to imagine    our Sabine Woman wounded to make her into the subject    of a love story.        2.    Love at first sight is a hypnosis: I am fascinated    by an image: at first shaken, electrified, stunned, "paralyzed" as Menon was by Socrates, the model of loved    objects, of captivating images, or again converted by an    apparition, nothing distinguishing the path of enamoration    from the Road to Damascus; subsequently ensnared, held    fast, immobilized, nose stuck to the image (the mirror).    In that moment when the other's image comes to ravish    me for the first time, I am nothing more than the Jesuit    Athan asius Kirchner's wonderful Hen: feet tied, the hen    went to sleep with her eyes fixed on the chalk line, which    was traced not far from her beak; when she was untied,    she remained motionless, fascinated, "submitting to her    vanquisher," as the Jesuit says (1646); yet, to waken her    from her enchantment, to break off the violence of her    Image-repertoire (vehemens animalis imaginatio), it was    enough to tap her on the wing; she shook herself and    began pecking in the dust again.           3.    The hypnotic episode, it is said, is ordinarily preceded by a twilight state: the subject is in a sense empty,    available, offered unwittingly to the rape which will surprise him. In the same way Werther describes at some    length the trivial life he leads at Wahlheim before meeting    Charlotte: no mundanity, no leisure, only reading Homer,    a kind of blank and prosaic daily round, lulling him (he    has nothing but pease porridge). This "wondrous serenity" is merely a waiting - a desire: I never fall in love    unless I have wanted to; the emptiness I produce in myself       (and on which, like Werther, quite innocently, I pride    myself) is nothing but that interval, longer or shorter,    when I glance around me, without seeming to, looking for    who to love. Of course' love requires a release switch, just    as in the case of animal rape; the bait is occasional, but    the structure is profound, regular, just as the mating season is seasonal. Yet the myth of "love at first sight" is so    powerful ( something that falls over me, without my expecting it, without my wanting it, without my taking the    least part in it) that we are astonished if we hear of someone's deciding to fall in love: for example, Amadour seeing Florida at the court of the Viceroy of Catalonia:    "After having gazed at her a long while, he determined    upon loving her"; se delibera. Indeed, shall I deliberate if    I must go mad (is love, then, that madness I want?)?        4.    In the animal world, the release switch of the sexual mechanism is not a specific individual but only a form,       191       a bright-colored fetish (which is how the Image-repertoire       starts up). In the fascinating image, what impresses me       (like a sensitized paper) is not the accumulation of its       details but this or that inflection. What suddenly manages       to touch me (ravish me) in the other is the voice, the line       of the shoulders, the slenderness of the silhouette, the       warmth of the hand, the curve of a smile, etc. Whereupon,       what does the aesthetic of the image matter? Something       accommodates itself exactly to my desire (about which I       know nothing); I shall therefore make no concessions to       style. Sometimes it is the other's conformity to a great       cultural model which enthralls me Cl imagine I see the       other painted by an artist of the past); sometimes, on the       contrary, it is a certain insolence of the apparition which       will open the wound: I can fall in love with a slightly       vulgar attitude (assumed out of provocation): there are    subtle, evanescent trivialities which swiftly pass over the       other's body: a brief (but excessive) way of parting the       fingers, of spreading the legs, of moving the fleshy part of       the lips in eating, of going about some very prosaic occupation, of making one's body utterly idiotic for an instant, to keep oneself in countenance (what is fascinating       about the other's "triviality" is just this, perhaps: that for       a very brief interval I surprise in the other, detached from       the rest of his person, something like a gesture of prostitution). The feature which touches me refers to a fragment       of behavior, to the fugitive moment of an attitude, a posture, in short to a scheme, schema, is the body in       movement, in situation, in life).       5.       Stepping out of the carriage, Werther sees Charlotte for the first time (and falls in love with her), framed       by the door of her house (cutting bread-and-butter for the       children: a famous scene, often discussed): the first thing       we love is a scene. For love at first sight requires the very       sign of its suddenness (what makes me irresponsible, subject to fatality, swept away, ravished): and of all the arrangements of objects, it is the scene which seems to be       seen best for the first time: a curtain parts: what had not       yet ever been seen is discovered in its entirety, and then       devoured by the eyes: what is immediate stands for what       is fulfilled: I am initiated: the scene consecrates the object       I am going to love.           Anything is likely to ravish me which can reach me       through a ring, a rip, a rent: "The first time I saw X       through a car window: the window shifted, like a lens       searching out who to love in the crowd; and then - immobilized by some accuracy of my desire? - I focused on       that apparition whom I was henceforth to follow for       months; but the other, as if he sought to resist this fresco       in which he was lost as a subject, whenever he was subsequently to appear in my field of vision (walking into the       cafe where I was waiting for him, for example) did so       with every precaution, a minimo, impregnating his body       with discretion and a kind of indifference, delaying his       recognition of me, etc.: in short, trying to keep himself out       of the picture."           Is the scene always visual? It can be aural, the frame can       be linguistic: I can fall in love with a sentence spoken to       me: and not only because it says something which manages to touch my desire, but because of its syntactical turn       (framing), which will inhabit me like a memory.              6.    When Werther "discovers" Charlotte (when the       curtain parts and the scene appears), Charlotte is cutting       bread-and-butter. What Ranold falls in love with is a       woman walking (Gradiva: the one who comes toward       him), and furthermore glimpsed within the frame of a       bas-relief. What fascinates, what ravishes me is the image       of a body in situation. What excites me is an outline in ac   tion, which pays no attention to me: Grusha, the young       servant, makes a powerful impression on the Wolf-man:       she is on her knees, scrubbing the floor. For the posture       of action, of labor, guarantees, in a way, the innocence o f       the image: the more the other grants me signs of his occupation, of his indifference, of my absence, the surer I       am of surprising him, as if, in order to fall in love, I had       to perform the ancestral formality of rape, i.e., surprise       (I surprise the other and thereby he surprises me: I did       not expect to surprise him).           7.       There is a deception in amorous time (this deception is called: the love story). I believe (along with everyone else) that the amorous phenomenon is an "episode"       endowed with a beginning (love at first sight) and an end       (suicide, abandonment, disaffection, withdrawal, monastery, travel, etc.). Yet the initial scene during which I was       ravished is merely reconstituted: it is after the fact. I reconstruct a traumatic image which I experience in the       present but which I conjugate (which I speak) in the past:           Je le vis, je rougis, je pillis a sa vue.       Un trouble s'eleva dans mon ame eperdue.       I saw him, blushed, turned pale when our eyes met.       Confusion seized my bewildered soul.       Love at first sight is always spoken in the past tense: it    might be called an anterior immediacy. The image is perfectly adapted to this temporal deception: distinct, abrupt,    framed, it is already (again, always) a memory (the    nature of the photograph is not to represent but to memorialize): when I "review" the scene of the rape, I retrospectively create a stroke of luck: this scene has all the magnificence of an accident: I cannot get over having had this    good fortune: to meet what matches my desire; or to have    taken this huge risk: instantly to submit to an unknown    image (and the en tire reconstructed scene functions like    the sumptuous montage of an ignorance).    Regretted?         regrette / regretted           Imagining himself dead, the amorous subject sees       the loved being's life continue as if nothing had       happened.           1.       Werther overhears Lotte and one of her friends       gossiping; they are talking quite indifferently about a dying       man: "And yet... if you were to die, if you vanished       out of their lives?... Would your friends even notice?       How deeply would they feel the loss? How long would       your disappearance affect their destiny?... "           Not that I imagine myself dying without leaving regrets       behind: the obituary is determined: rather that through       the mourning itself, which 1 do not deny, 1 see the lives of       others continuing, without change; I see them persevering       in their occupations, their pastimes, their problems, frequenting the same places, the same friends; nothing would       change in the train of their existence. Out of love, the       delirious assumption of Dependence (I have an absolute       need of the other), is generated, quite cruelly, the adverse       position: no one has any real need of me.        (Only the Mother can regret: to be depressed, it is said, is       to resemble the Mother as 1 imagine her regretting me       eternally: a dead, motionless image out of the nekuia,' but       the others are not the Mother: for them, mourning; for       me, depression.)          2.    What increases Werther's panic is that the dying       man (in whom he projects himself) is being gossiped       about: Charlotte and her friends are "silly women" speaking frivolously about death. I envision myself nibbled up       by others' words, dissolved in the ether of Gossip. And the       Gossip will continue without my constituting any further       part of it, no longer its object: a linguistic energy, trivial       and tireless, will triumph over my very memory.        "How blue       the sky was"         rencontre / encounter           The figure refers to the happy interval immediately       following the first ravishment, before the       difficulties of the amorous relationship begin.        1.       Though the lover's discourse is no more than a    dust of figures stirring according to an unpredictable    order, like a fly buzzing in a room, I can assign to love, at    least retrospectively, according to my Image-repertoire, a    settled course: it is by means of this historical hallucination that I sometimes make love into a romance, an adventure. This would appear to assume three stages (or    three acts): first comes the instantaneous capture (I am    ravished by an image); then a series of encounters (dates,    telephone calls, letters, brief trips), during which I ecstatically "explore" the perfection of the loved being, i.e., the    un hoped-for correspondence between an object and my    desire: this is the sweetness of the beginning, the interval    proper to the idyll. This happy period acquires its identity    (its limits) from its opposition (at least in memory) to    the "sequel": the "sequel" is the long train of sufferings,    wounds, anxieties, distresses, resentments, despairs, em   barrassments, and deceptions to which I fall prey, ceaselessly living under the threat of a downfall which would       envelop at once the other, myself, and the glamorous encounter that first revealed us to each other.        2.       Some lovers do not commit suicide: it is possible       for me to emerge from that "tunnel" which follows the       amorous encounter. I see daylight again, either because I       manage to grant unhappy love a dialectical outcome (retaining the love but getting rid of the hypnosis) or because       I abandon that love altogether and set out again, trying to       reiterate, with others, the encounter whose dazzlement remains with me: for it is of the order of the "first pleasure"       and I cannot rest until it recurs: I affirm the affirmation,       I begin again, without repeating.        (The encounter is radiant; later on, in memory, the subject will telescope into one the three moments of the       amorous trajectory; he will speak of "love's dazzling       tunnel. ")        3.       In the encounter, I marvel that I have found someone who, by successive touches, each one successful, unfailing, completes the painting of my hallucination; I am       like a gambler whose luck cannot fail, so that his hand       unfailingly lands on the little piece which immediately       completes the puzzle of his desire. This is a gradual discovery (and a kind of verification) of affinities, complicities, and intimacies which I shall (I imagine) eternally       sustain with the other, who is thereby becoming "my       other": I am totally given over to this discovery (I       tremble within it), to the point where any intense curiosity       for someone encountered is more or less equivalent to love       (it is certainly love which the young Moraite feels for the       traveler Chateaubriand, greedily watching his slightest gesture and following him until his departure). At every       moment of the encounter, I discover in the other another       myself: You like this? So do If You don't like that?       Neither do If When Buvard and Pecuchet meet for the first       time, they marvel over the catalogue of their shared tastes:       the scene, beyond all doubt, is a love scene. The Encounter casts upon the (already ravished) amorous subject the dazzlement of a supernatural stroke of luck: love       belongs to the (Dionysiac) order of the Cast of the dice.        (Neither knows the other yet. Hence they must tell each       other: "This is what I am. "This is narrative bliss, the       R.H.       kind which both fulfills and delays knowledge, in a word,       restarts it. In the amorous encounter, I keep rebounding - I am light.)          Reverberation         retentissement / reverberation           Fundamental mode of amorous subjectivity: a       word, an image reverberates painfully in the       subject's affective consciousness.           1.    What echoes in me is what I learn with my body:       something sharp and tenuous suddenly wakens this body,       which, meanwhile, had languished in the rational knowledge of a general situation: the word, the image, the       thought function like a whiplash. My inward body begins       vibrating as though shaken by trumpets answering each       other, drowning each other out: the incitation leaves its       trace, the trace widens and everything is (more or less       rapidly) ravaged. In the lover's Image-repertoire, nothing       distinguishes the most trivial provocation from an authentically consequent phenomenon; time is jerked forward       (catastrophic predictions flood to my mind) and back (I       remember certain " precedents" with terror): starting from       a negligible trifle, a whole discourse of memory and death       rises up and sweeps me away: this is the kingdom of       memory, weapon of reverberation - of what Nietzsche       called ressentiment.           (Reverberation comes from Diderot's "unforeseen incident which... suddenly alters the state of the characters":       it is a coup de theatre, the "favorable moment" of a painting: pathetic scene of the ravaged, prostrated subject.)           2.       The space of reverberation is the body - that       imaginary body, so "coherent" (coalescent) that I can       experience it only in the form of a generalized pang. This       pang (analogous to a blush which reddens the face, with       shame or emotion) is a sudden panic. In the usual kind of       panic - the stage fright which precedes some sort of performance - I see myself in the future in a condition of failure, imposture, scandal. In amorous panic, I am afraid       of my own destruction, which I suddenly glimpse, inevitable, clearly formed, in the flash of a word, an image.        3.       When his sentences ran dry, Flaubert flung himself       on his divan: he called this his "marinade." If the thing       reverberates too powerfully, it makes such a din in my       body that I must halt any occupation; I stretch out on my       bed and give in without a struggle to the "inner storm";       contrary to the Zen monk who empties himself of his       images, I let myself be filled by them, I indulge their bitterness to the full. Depression has its own-encoded-gestus, then, and doubtless that is what limits it; for it       suffices that at a given moment I can substitute another       (even blank) gesture for this one (getting up, going to my       desk, without necessarily working there, right away), to       make the reverberation die down, giving way to no more       than ennui. The bed (by day) is the site of the Image-repertoire; the desk is once again, and whatever one does       there, reality.          4.       X tells me about a disagreeable rumor which concerns me. This incident reverberates within me in two       ways: on the one hand, I receive the object of the message       at point-blank range, outraged by its imposture, eager to       deny it, etc.; on the other hand, I am perfectly conscious       of the little impulse of aggression which has impelled X       - without his being exactly aware of it himself - to pass       on this wounding intelligence. Traditional linguistics would       analyze only the message: conversely, active Philology       would try especially to interpret, to evaluate the (here,       reactive) force which directs (or attracts) it. Now, what is       it that I do? I conjugate the two linguistic series, amplify       them by each other: I establish myself, however painfully,       in the very substance of the message (i.e., the content of       the rumor), while I bitterly and mistrustfully scrutinize       the force which warrants it: I lose on both counts,       wounded on all sides. This is reverberation: the zealous       practice of a perfect reception: contrary to the analyst       (and with reason), far from "floating" while the other       speaks, I listen completely, in a state of total consciousness: I cannot keep from hearing everything, and it is the       purity of this reception which is painful to me: who can       tolerate without pain a meaning that is complex and yet       purified of any " noise" or interference? Reverberation       makes reception into an intelligible din, and the lover into       a monstrous receiver, reduced to an enormous auditive       organ - as if listening itself were to become a state of       utterance: in me, it is the ear which speaks.           Aubade         reveil / waking           Various modes by which the amorous subject finds       upon waking that he is once again besieged by the       anxieties of his passion.        1.    Werther speaks of his exhaustion ("Let me suffer    to the end: for all my exhaustion, I still have strength enough for that"). Amorous anxiety involves an expenditure which tires the body as harshly as any physical labor.    "I suffered so much," someone said, "I struggled so hard    all day with the image of the loved being, that I always    slept very well at night." And Werther, shortly before    committing suicide, goes to bed and sleeps very soundly.        2.       Modes of waking:       sad, wracked (with tenderness), affect less, innocent,       panic-stricken (Octave comes    to, after fainting: "All of a       sudden his miseries were clear    in his mind: one does not       die of pain, or he was a dead    man at that moment").        Making Scenes      scene / scene        The figure comprehends every "scene" (in the    household sense of the term) as an exchange of    reciprocal contestations.        1.    When two subjects argue according to a set exchange of remarks and with a view to having the " last    word," these two subjects are already married: for them    the scene is an exercise of a right, the practice of a language of which they are co-owners; each one in his turn,    says the scene, which means: never you without m e, and    reciprocally. This is the meaning of what is euphemistically called dialogue: not to listen to each other, but to    submit in common to an egalitarian principle of the distribution of language goods. T he partners know that the    confrontation in which they are engaged, and which will    not separate them, is as inconsequential as a perverse    form of pleasure (the scene is a way of taking pleasure    without the risk of having children).        With the first scene, language begins its long career as an    agitated, useless thing. It is dialogue (the joust of two    actors) which corrupted Tragedy, even before Socrates    appeared on the scene. Monologue is thereby pushed back    to the very limits of humanity: in archaic tragedy, in cer   tain forms of schizophrenia, in amorous soliloquy (at least       as long as I "keep" my delirium and do not yield to the       desire to draw the o ther into a set contestation of language). It is as if the proto-actor, the madman, and the       lover refused to posit themselves as hero of speech and to       submit to adult language, the social language to which       they are prompted by the wicked Eris: the language of       universal neurosis.        2.       Werther is pure discourse of the amorous subject:       the (idyllic, anguished) monologue is broken only once,    at the end, just before the suicide: Werther pays a visit to       Charlotte, who asks him not to come and see her again       before Christmas day, thereby signifying to him that he    must visit less frequently and that henceforth his passion       will no longer be " received": there follows a scene. The       scene starts with a disagreement: Charlotte is embarrassed, Werther is excited, and Charlotte's embarrassment       excites Werther all the more: thus the scene has only one       subject, divided by a differential of energy (the scene is       electric). So that this disequilibrium can catch (like a       motor), so that the scene can get into its proper gear,       there must be a bait or decoy which each of the two       partners tries to draw into hi s own camp; this bait is usually a fact (which one affirms and the other denies) or a       deci sion (which one imposes and the other rejects: in       Werther, to visit less frequently). Agreement is logically       impossible insofar as what is being argued is not the fact       or the decision, i.e., something which is outside language,       but only precedes it: the scene has no object or at least       very soon loses its object: it is that language whose object       is lost. It is characteristic of the individual remark s in a       scene to have no demonstrative, persuasive end, but only       206       an origin, and this origin is never anything but immediate:       in the scene, I cling to what has just been said. The       (divided and yet mutual) subject of the scene is uttered in       distichs: this is stichomythia, the archaic model of all the       scenes in the world (when we are in a "state of scene," we       speak in " rows" of words). Yet, whatever the regularity of       this mechanism, the initial differential must be discoverable in each distich: thus Charlotte always turns her       argument toward general propositions ( " It's because it is       impossible that yo u desire me at all"), and Werther always brings hi s argument back to contingence, god of       amorous injury ("Your decision must have been made by       Albert" ). Each argument (each verse of the distich) is       chose n so that it wi ll be symmetrical and, so to speak,       equal to its brother, and yet augmented with an additional       protest; in short, with a higher bid. This bid is never anything but Narcissus's cry: Me! And me! What about me!        3.       The scene is like the Sentence: structurally, there       is no obligation for it to stop; no internal constraint exhausts it, beca use, as in the Sentence, once the core is       given ( the fact, the decision), the expansion s a re infinitely       renewable. Only some circumstance ex tern al to its structure can interrupt the scene: the exhaustion of the two       partners (that of only one would not suffice), the arrival       of a third party (in Werther, it is Albert), or else the       sudden substitution of desire for aggress ion. Unless these       accidents are employed, no partner has the power to check       a scene. What means might I have? Silence? It would       merely quicken the will to have the scene; I am therefore       obliged to answer in order to soothe, to erase. Reasoning?       None is of such pure metal as to leave the other partner    without something to say. Analysis of the scene itself? To       shift from the scene to the metascene merely means opening another scene. Flight? This is the sign of a defection       already achieved: the couple is already undone: like love,       the scene is always reciprocal. Hence, the scene is interminable, like language itself: it is language itself, taken       in its infinity, that " perpetual adoration" which brings       matters about in such a way that since man has existed, he       has not stopped talking.           (The good thing about X was that he never exploited the       sentence that was given to him; by a kind of rare askesis,       he did not take advantage of language. )           4.       No scene has a meaning, no scene moves toward       an enlightenment or a transformation. The scene is neither       practical nor dialectical; it is a luxury - and idle: as inconsequential as a perverse orgasm: it does not leave a       mark, it does not sully. Paradox: in Sade, violence, too,       does not leave a mark; the body is instantaneously restored - for new expenditures: endlessly lacerated,       tainted, crushed, Justine is always fresh, whole, rested; the       same is true of the scene's partners: they are reborn from       the past scene as if nothing had occurred. By the very       insignificance of its tumult, the scene recalls the Roman       style of vomiting: I tickle my uvula (I rouse myself to       contestation), I vomit (a flood of wounding arguments),       and then, quite calmly, I begin eating again.        5.    Insignificant as it is, the scene nonetheless struggles against insignificance. Each partner of a scene dreams       of having the last word. To speak last, " to conclude," is to       208    assign a destiny to everything that has been said, is to    master, to possess, to absolve, to bludgeon meaning; in the    space of speech, the one who comes last occupies a    sovereign position, held, according to an established privilege, by professors, presidents, judges, confessors: every    language combat (the machia of the Sophists, the disputatio of the Scholastics) seeks to gain possession of this    position; by the last word, I will disorganize, "liquidate"    the adversary, inflicting upon him a (narcissistically)    mortal wound, cornering him in silence, castrating him of    all speech. The scene passes with a view to this triumph:    there is no question whatever that each remark should    contribute to the victory of a truth, gradually constructing    this truth, but only that the last remark be the right one: it    is the last throw of the dice which counts. The scene bears    no resemblance to a chess game, but rather to a game of    hunt-the-slipper: yet here the game is inverted, for the    victory goes to the one who manages to keep the slipper in    hi s hand at the very moment the game stops: the slipper    changes hands throughout the scene, and the victory goes    to the player who captures that little creature whose possession assures omnipotence: the last word.        In Werther, the scene is crowned with a blackmail:    "Grant me only a little peace and everything will be    settled," Werther says to Charlotte in a plaintive yet    threatening tone: which is to say: "You will soon be rid of    me": a proposition marked with a certain voluptuous    quality, for it is in fact hallucinated as a last word. In    order that the subject of the scene be furnished with a    truly peremptory la st word, it requires no less than suicide: by the announcement of suicide, Werther immediately becomes the stronger of the two: whereby we see    once again that only death can interrupt the Sentence, the    Scene.        What is a hero? The one who has the last word. Can we    think of a hero who does not speak before dying? To    renounce the last word (to refuse to have a scene)    derives, then, from an anti-heroic morality: that of    Abraham: to the end of the sacrifice demanded of him, he    does not speak. Or else, as a more subversive because less    theatrical riposte (silence is always sufficient theater), the    last word may be replaced by an incongruous pirouette:    this is what the Zen master did who, for his only answer to    the solemn question "What is Buddha?," took off his    sandal, put it on his head, and walked away: impeccable    dissolution of the last word, mastery of non-mastery.           "No clergyman       attended"         seul / alone           The figure refers, not to what the human solitude       of the amorous subject may be, but to his       "philosophical" solitude, love-as-passion being       accounted for today by no major system of       thought (of discourse).           1.       What do we call that subject who persists in an    "error" against and counter to everyone, as if he had before himself all eternity in which to be "mistaken"? We    call him a relapse. Whether it be from one lover to the next    or within one and the same love, I keep "falling back"    into an interior doctrine which no one shares with me.    When Werther's body is taken by night to a corner of the    cemetery, near two lindens (the tree whose simple odor is    that of memory and sleep), "no clergyman attended" (the    novel's last sentence). Religion condemns in Werther not    only the suicide but also, perhaps, the lover, the utopian,    the class heretic, the man who is "ligatured" to no one but    himself.           2. In the Symposium, Eryximachus notes with some    irony that he has read somewhere a panegyric of salt, but    nothing on Eros, and it is because Eros is censured as a    subject of conversation that the little society of the    Symposium decides to make this the subject of its round       table: rather like today's intellectuals reluctantly agreeing       to discuss, precisely, Love and not politics, (amorous)       Desire and not (social) Need. The eccentricity of the conversation derives from the fact that this conversation is       systematic: what the guests try to produce are not proved       remarks, accounts of experiences, but a doctrine: for each       of them, Eros is a system. Today, however, there is no       system of love: and the several systems which surround       the contemporary lover offer him no room (except for an       extremely devaluated place): turn as he will toward one       or another of the received languages, none answers him,       except in order to turn him away from what he loves.       Christian discourse, if it still exists, exhorts him to repress       and to sublimate. Psychoanalytical discourse (which, at       least, describes his state) commits him to give up his       Image-repertoire as lost. As for Marxist discourse, it has       nothing to say. If it should occur to me to knock at these       doors in order to gain recognition somewhere (wherever it       might be) for my "madness" (my "truth"), these doors       close one after the other; and when they are all shut, there       rises around me a wall of language which oppresses and       repulses me - unless I repent and agree to "get rid of X."        ("I have had that nightmare about a loved person who       was sick in the street and begged the passers-by for help;       but everyone refused him harshly, despite my own hysterical attempts to obtain medicine; the anguish of this loved       person then became hysterical, for which I reproached       him. I understood a little later that his person was myself    - of course; who else is there to dream about?: I was       appealing to all the passing languages (systems), rejected       by them and pleading with all my might, indecently, for    a philosophy which might 'understand' me - might 'shelter' me.")           3.    The lover's solitude is not a solitude of person    (love confides, speaks, tells itself), it is a solitude of system: I am alone in making a system out of it (perhaps    because I am ceaselessly flung back on the solipsism of my    discourse). A difficult paradox: I can be understood by    everyone (love comes from books, its dialect is a common    one), but I can be heard (received "prophetically") only    by subjects who have exactly and right now the same language I have. Lovers, Alcibiades says, are like those a    viper has bitten: "They are unwilling, it is said, to speak    of their misfortune to anyone except those who have    been victims of it as well, as being the only ones in a    position to conceive and to excuse all they have dared to    say and do in the throes of their pain": paltry troupe of    "Starved souls," the Suicides for love (how many times    will not one and the same lover commit suicide?), to    whom no great language (save, fragmentarily, that of the    passe Novel) lends its voice.           4.       Like the early mystic, scarcely tolerated by the    ecclesiastical society in which he lived, as an amorous subject I neither confront nor contest: quite simply, I have no    dialogue: with the instruments of power, of thought, of    knowledge, of action, etc.; I am not necessarily "depoliticized": my deviation consists in not being "excited." In    return, society subjects me to a strange, public repression:    no censure, no prohibition: I am merely suspended a    humanis, far from human things, by a tacit decree of in213       significance: I belong to no repertoire, participate in       no asylum.           5.       Why I am alone:       "Every man has his wealth,    I alone appear impoverished.    My mind is that of an ignorant man    because it is very slow.    Every man is clear-sighted,    I alone am in darkness.    Every man has a sharp wit,    I alone have a clouded mind    Which floats with the sea, blows with the wind.    Every man has his goal,    I alone have the dull mind of a peasant.    I alone am different from other men,    For I seek to suckle at my Mother's breast."       The Uncertainty       of Signs         signes / signs           Whether he seeks to prove his love, or to discover       if the other loves him, the amorous subject has no       system of sure signs at his disposal.        1.       I look for signs, but of what? What is the object of       my reading? Is it: am I loved (am I loved no longer, am I       st ill loved) ? Is it my future that I am trying to read,       deciphering in what is inscribed the announcement of what       will happen to me, according to a method which combines       paleography and manticism? Isn't it rather, all things considered, that I remain suspended on this question, whose       answer I tirelessly seek in the other's face: What am I       worth?        2.       The power of the Image-repertoire is immediate: I       do not look for the image, it comes to me, all of a sudden.       It is afterwards that I return to it and begin making the       good sign alternate, interminably, with the bad one:       " What do these abrupt words mean: you have all my       respect? Was anything ever colder? Is this a complete       return to the old intimacy? Or a polite way to cut short a       disagreeable explanation?" Like Stendhal's Octave, I       never know what is normal; lacking (as I well know) all    reason, I would prefer, in order to decide on an interpretation, to trust myself to common sense; but common sense       affords me no more than contradictory evidence: "After       all, it's not really normal to go out in the middle of the       night and to come home four hours later!" "After all, it's       only normal to go out and take a walk when you can't       sleep," etc. A man who wants the truth is never answered       save in strong, highly colored images, which nonetheless       turn ambiguous, indecisive, once he tries to transform       them into signs: as in any manticism, the consulting lover       must make his own truth.        3.       Freud to his fiancee: " The only thing that makes       me suffer is being in a situation where it is impossible for       me to prove my love to you. " And Gide: " Everything in       her behavior seemed to say: Since he no longer loves me,       nothing matters to me. Now, I still loved her, and in fact I       had never loved her so much; but it was no longer possible       for me to prove it to her. That was much the worst thing       of all."           Signs are not proofs, since anyone can produce false or       ambiguous signs. Hence one falls back, paradoxically, on       the omnipotence of language: since nothing assures language, I will regard it as the sole and final assurance: I       shall no longer believe in interpretation. I shall receive       every word from my other as a sign of truth; and when I       speak, I shall not doubt that he, too, receives what I say as       the truth. Whence the importance of declarations; I want       to keep wresting from the other the formula of his feeling,       and I keep telling him, on my side, that I love him: nothing is left to suggestion, to divination: for a thing to be       known, it must be spoken; but also, once it is spoken, even       very provisionally, it is true.          "E lucevan le stelle"         souvenir / remembrance           Happy and / or tormenting remembrance of an       object, a gesture, a scene, linked to the loved being       and marked by the intrusion of the imperfect       tense into the grammar of the lover's discourse.        1.    "It is a glorious summer, and I often sit up in the       trees of Lotte's orchard and take down with a long pole       the pears from the highest branches. She stands below and       catches them when I lower the pole." Werther is telling his       story, and speaks in the present tense, but his scene already has the vocation of a remembrance; in an undertone, the imperfect tense murmurs behind this present.       One day, 1 shall recall the scene, I shall lose myself in the       past. The amorous scene, like the first ravishment, consists       only of after-the-fact manipulations: this is anamnesis,       which recovers only insignificant features in no way       dramatic, as if I remembered time itself and only time: it       is a fragrance without support, a texture of memory;       something like a pure expenditure, such as only the       Japanese haiku has been able to articulate, without       recuperating it in any destiny.        (To gather the figs from the high branches in the garden in       B., there was a long bamboo pole and a tin funnel stamped       with rosettes that was fastened to it: this childhood memory functions in the same way as an amorous one.)        2.    "The stars were shining." Never again will this    happiness return just this way. Anamnesis both fulfills and    lacerates me.           The imperfect is the tense of fascination: it seems to be    alive and yet it doesn't move: imperfect presence, imperfect death; neither oblivion nor resurrection; simply the    exhausting lure of memory. From the start, greedy to play    a role, scenes take their position in memory: often I feel    this, I foresee this, at the very moment when these scenes    are forming. - This theater of time is the very contrary of    the search for lost time; for I remember pathetically, punctually, and not philosophically, discursively: I remember in order to be unhappy/happy - not in order to    understand. I do not write, I do not shut myself up in    order to write the enormous novel of time recaptured.        Ideas of Suicide      suicide / suicide        In the amorous realm, the desire for suicide is    frequent: a trifle provokes it.        1.    For the slightest injury, I want to commit suicide: upon meditation, amorous suicide does figure as a motif.    The notion is a light one - an easy idea, a kind of rapid    algebra which my discourse requires at this particular    moment; I grant it no substantial consistency, nor do I    foresee the heavy decor, the trivial consequences of death:    I scarcely know how I am going to kill myself. It is a    phrase, only a sentence, which I darkly caress but from    which a trifle will distract me. "And the man who for three    quarters of an hour had just planned his own death stood    at this very moment on a chair to search his bookshelves    for the price list of the Saint-Gobain mirrors."           2.       Sometimes, in the brilliant light cast by some    trivial circumstance and swept away by the reverberations    the incident has provoked, I suddenly see myself caught in    the trap, immobilized in an impossible situation (site):    there are only two ways out (either... or) and they    are both barred: nothing to be said in either direction.    Then the idea of suicide saves me, for I can speak it (and    do not fail to do so): I am reborn and dye this idea with    the colors of life, either directing it aggressively against the    loved object (a familiar blackmail) or in fantasy uniting          myself with the loved object in death ("I shall lie down in       the grave, pressed close against you").           3.    Upon discussion, the scientists conclude that       animals do not commit suicide; at most, certain species - horses, dogs - have an impulse to self-mutilation. Yet it is       apropos of horses that Werther intimates the nobility       which marks every suicide: "I have been told that a noble       breed of horses, when overheated and hunted almost to       death, will by instinct bite open a vein and so recover their       breath. I often feel the same. I should like to open one of       my veins and gain eternal freedom for myself."        Gide's silliness: "Just finished rereading Werther, not       without irritation. I had forgotten how long it took him to       die [which is not at all the case]. He keeps going on and       on, until you want to give him a push, right into the grave.       Four or five times, what you had hoped was his last breath       is followed by another even more ultimate one... the       extended leave-takings exasperate me." Gide doesn't realize that in the novel of love, the hero is real (because he is       created out of an absolutely projective substance in which       every amorous subject collects himself), and that what he    is looking for here is a man's death - is my death.       Thus         tel / thus           Endlessly required to define the loved object, and       suffering from the uncertainties of this definition,       the amorous subject dreams of a knowledge which       would let him take the other as he is, thus and no       other, exonerated from any adjective.           1.    Narrow-mindedness: as a matter of fact, I admit       nothing about the other, I understand nothing. Everything       about the other which doesn't concern me seems alien,       hostile; I then feel toward him a mixture of alarm and       severity: I fear and I reprove the loved being, once he no       longer "sticks" to his image. I am merely "liberal": a       doleful dogmatic, so to speak.        (Industrious, indefatigable, the language machine humming inside me - for it runs nicely - fabricates its chain of       adjectives: I cover the other with adjectives, I string out       his qualities, his qualitas.)        2.    Through these iridescent, versatile judgments, a       painful impression subsists: I see that the other perseveres       in himself; he is himself this perseverance, against which I       stumble. I realize with hysteria that I cannot displace him;       whatever I do, whatever I expend for him, he never       renounces his own system. I contradictorily experience the       other as a capricious divinity who keeps changing his       moods in my respect, and as a heavy, inveterate thing    (this thing will age just as it is, and that is what I suffer    from). Or again, I see the other in his limits. Or finally, I    question myself: Is there even a single point as to which    the other might surprise me? Thus, curiously, the other's    "freedom to be himself" I experience as a cowardly stubbornness. I see the other thus - I see the other's thusness    - but in the realm of amorous sentiment this thus is painful to me because it separates us and because, once again,    I refuse to recognize the division of our image, the other's    alterity.           3. This first thus is wrong because I leave on the    blotter, as an internal point of corruption, an adjective:    the other is stubborn: he still derives from qualitas. I must    get rid of any impulse to draw up accounts; the other must    become, in my eyes, pure of any attribution; the more I    designate hi m, the less I shall utter him: I shall be like the    infans who contents himself with a bl ank word to show    something: Ta, Da, Tat (says Sanskrit). Thus, the lover    will say: you are thus, thus and so, precisely thus.        Designating you as thus, I enable you to escape the death    of classification, I kidnap you from the Other, from language, I want you to be immortal. As he is, the loved    being no longer receives any meaning, neither from myself    nor from the system in which he is caught; he is no more    than a text without context; I no longer need or desire to    decipher him; he is in a sense the supplement of his own    site. If he were only a site, I might well, someday, replace    him, but I can substitute nothing for the supplement of his    site, his thus.        (In restaurants, once the last service is over, the tables are    set again for the next day: same white cloth, same silverware, same salt and pepper shakers: this is the world of    site, of replacement: no thus.)           4.       So I accede, fitfully, to a language without adjectives. I love the other, not according to his (accountable)    qualities, but according to his existence; by a movement    one might well call mystical, I love, not what he is, but    that he is. The language in which the amorous subject then    protests (against all the nimble languages of the world) is    an obtuse language: every judgment is suspended, the    terror of meaning is abolished. What I liquidate in this    movement is the very category of merit: just as the mystic    makes himself indifferent to sanctity (which would still be    an attribute), so, acceding to the other's thus, I no longer    oppose oblation to desire: it seems to me that I can make    myself desire the other less and delight in him more.           (The worst enemy of thus is Gossip, corrupt manufacturer    of adjectives. And what would best resemble the loved    being as he is, thus and so, would be the Text, to which I    can add no adjective: which I delight in without having to    decipher it.)        5.    Or again: is not thus the friend? He who can leave    for a while without his image crumbling? "We were    friends and have become estranged. But this was right,    and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed. We are two    ships each of which has its goal and course; our paths may    cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did -       and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor       and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had       reached their goal and as if they had one goal. But then       the mighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into       different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never       see each other again; perhaps we shall meet again but fail       to recognize each other: our exposure to different seas and       suns has changed us."           Tenderness         tendresse / tenderness           Bliss, but also a disturbing evaluation of the loved       object's tender gestures, insofar as the subject       realizes that he is not their privileged recipient.           1.    There is not only need for tenderness, there is also       need to be tender for the other: we shut ourselves up in a       mutual kindness, we mother each other reciprocally; we       return to the root of all relations, where need and desire       join. The tender gesture says: ask me anything that can       put your body to sleep, but also do not forget that I desire       you - a little, lightly, without trying to seize anything right       away.           Sexual pleasure is not metonymic: once taken, it is cut       off: it was the Feast, always terminated and instituted only       by a temporary, supervised lifting of the prohibition. Tenderness, on the contrary, is nothing but an infinite, insatiable metonymy; the gesture, the episode of tenderness       (the delicious harmony of an evening) can only be interrupted with laceration: everything seems called into question once again: return of rhythm-vritti-disappearance       of nirvana.        2. If I receive the tender gesture within the field of       demand, I am fulfilled: is this gesture not a kind of             miraculous crystallization of presence? But if I receive it       (and this can be simultaneous) within the field of desire, I       am disturbed: tenderness, by rights, is not exclusive,       hence I must admit that what I receive, others receive as       well (sometimes I am even afforded the spectacle of this).       Where you are tender, you speak your plural.        ("L was stupefied to see A give the waitress in the       Bavarian restaurant, while ordering his schnitzel, the same       tender look, the same angelic expression that moved him       so when these expressions were addressed to him.")        Union     union / union           Dream of total union with the loved being.           1.       Naming of the total union: "the sole and simple       pleasure" (Aristotle), "the joy without stain and without       mixture, the perfection of dreams, the term of all hopes"       (Ibn-Hazm), "the divine magnificence" (Novalis); it is       undifferentiated and undivided repose. Or again, the fulfillment of ownership; I dream that we delight in each    other according to an absolute appropriation; this is fruitful union, love's fruition (with its initial fricative and shifting vowels before the murmuring final syllable, the word       increases the delight it speaks of by an oral pleasure; saying it, I enjoy this union in my mouth).           2.    En sa moytie, ma moytie je recolle - to her half, I       rejoin my own half. I leave a (mediocre) film in which a          character evokes Plato and the theory of the       Hermaphrodites. Apparently, everyone knows the story of       the two halves trying to join themselves back together       (desire is to lack what one has - and to give what one       Lacan       does not have: a matter of supplements, not complements).        (I spend an afternoon trying to draw what Aristophanes'    hermaphrodite would look like: globular, with four hands,    four legs, four ears, just one head, one neck. Are the    halves back to back or face to face? Belly to belly, no    doubt, since Apollo was to sew them up again here, drawing the skin together and creating the navel: yet their faces    are facing away from each other, since Apollo was to turn    them toward the side where he had divided them; and the    genital organs are behind. I persist, but get nowhere, being    a poor draughtsman or an even poorer utopianist. The    hermaphrodite, or the androgyne, figure of that "ancient    unity of which the desire and the pursuit constitute what    we call love," is beyond my figuration; or at least all I    could achieve is a monstrous, grotesque, improbable body.    Out of dreams emerges a farce figure: thus, out of the mad    couple is born the obscenity of the household (one cooks,    for life, for the other).           3.       Phaedrus seeks the perfect image of the couple:    Orpheus and Eurydice? Not enough difference: Orpheus,    weakened, was nothing but a woman, and the gods caused    him to die at women's hands. Admetus and Alcestis?    Better: the wife substitutes herself for the failing parents,    she wrests the son from his name and gives him another:    thus there always remains a man in the business. Yet the    perfect couple is Achilles and PatrocIus: not according to    a homosexual parti pris, but because within the same sex    the difference remains inscribed: Patroclus was the lover,    Achilles the beloved. Thus - according to Nature, traditional wisdom, the myth - do not look for union    (amphimixis) outside the division of roles, if not of the    sexes: it is the couple's reason.        Eccentric (scandalous), the dream furnishes the contrary    image. In the dual form I fantasize, I want there to be a          point without an elsewhere, I sigh (not a very modern       action) for a centered structure, balanced by the consistency of the Same: if everything is not in two, what's the       use of struggling? I might as well return to the pursuit of       the multiple. As for this everything I desire, it suffices for       its fulfillment (the dream insists) that each of us be without sites: that we be able magically to substitute for each       other: that the kingdom of "one or the other" come ("In       going together, each will think for the other" ), as if we       were the vocables of a new, strange language, in which it       would be quite licit to use one word for another. This       union would be without limits, not by the scope of its       expansion, but by the indifference of its permutations.       (What do I care about a limited relation? It makes me       suffer. Doubtless, if someone were to ask me: "How are       things going with you and X?" I should reply: Right now       I'm exploring our limits; ninny that I am, I make the       advances, I circumscribe our common territory. But what       I dream of is all the others in a single person; for if I       united X, Y, and Z, by the line passing through all these       presently starred points, I should form a perfect figure:       my other would be born.)           4.    Dream of total union: everyone says this dream is       impossible, and yet it persists. I do not abandon it. "On       the Athenian steles, instead of the heroicization of death,       scenes of farewell in which one of the spouses takes leave       of the other, hand in hand, at the end of a contract which       only a third force can break, thus it is mourning which       achieves its expression here... I am no longer myself       without you." It is in represented mourning that we find       the proof of my dream; 1 can believe in it, since it is       mortal (the only impossible thing is immortality).    Truth     verite /    truth        Every episode of language refers to the "sensation    of truth" the amorous subject experiences in    thinking of his love, either because he believes he    is the only one to see the loved object "in its truth,"    or because he defines the specialty of his own    requirement as a truth concerning which he    cannot yield.           1.       The other is my good and my knowledge: only I    know him, only I make him exist in his truth. Whoever is    not me is ignorant of the other: "Sometimes I cannot    understand how another can, how he dare love her, since I    alone love her completely and devotedly, knowing only    her, and having nothing in the world but her! " Conversely,    the other establishes me in truth: it is only with the other    that I feel I am " myself. " I know more about myself than    all those who simply do not know this about me: that I    am in love.           (Love is blind: the proverb is false. Love opens his eyes    wide, love produces clear-sightedness: "I have, about you,    of you, absolute knowledge." Report of the clerk to the    master: You have every mastery of me, but I have every    knowledge of you.)           2.    Always the same reversal: what the world takes    for "objective," I regard as factitious; and what the world       regards as madness, illusion, error, I take for truth. It is in       the deepest part of the lure that the sensation of truth       comes to rest. The lure sheds its decor, it becomes so       pure, like a primary metal, that nothing can ever change       it: it is indestructible. Werther has made up his mind to       die: "I write you this without novelistic exaltation, quite       calmly. " Displacement: it is not the truth which is true,       but the relation to the lure which becomes true. To be in       the truth, it is enough to persist: a "lure" endlessly       affirmed, against everything, becomes a truth. (And suppose there might be, ultimately, in love-as-passion, a       fragment of real... truth. )        3.    The truth is what, being taken away, leaves noth   ing to be seen but death (as we say: life is no longer worth       living). Thus with the name of the Golem: Emeth       (Truth); take one letter away and he becomes Meth (he is       dead). Or again: truth is what, in the fantasy of hallucina   tion, must be delayed but not denied, betrayed: its irreducible portion, what I do not cease wanting to know       once before dying (another formulation: "Then I shall die       without having known... " etc.).        (The lover botches his castration? Out of this failure, he       persists in making a value.)       4. The truth: what is oblique. A monk once asked          Kao Tsu: "What is the unique and final word of truth?"       ... The master replied: "Yes." I take this answer not       as a vague prejudice in favor of general acquiescence as       the philosophical secret of truth. I understand that the       master, bizarrely opposing an adverb to a pronoun, yes to       what, replies obliquely; he makes a deaf man's answer, of       the same kind as he made to another monk who asked       him: "All things are said to be reducible to the One; but       to what is the One reducible?" And Kao Tsu replied:       "When I was in the Ching district, I had a robe made for       myself which weighed seven kin."           Sobria Ebrietas        vouloir-saisir / will-to-possess          Realizing that the difficulties of the amorous       relationship originate in his ceaseless desire to       appropriate the loved being in one way or another,       the subject decides to abandon henceforth all       "will-to-possess" in his regard.        1.    The lover's constant thought: the other owes me       what I need. Yet, for the first time, I am really afraid. I    fling myself on my bed, I mull over the situation and I       decide: from now on, I will not make any attempt to       possess the other.       The N.W.P. (the non-will-to-possess, an expression       imitated from the Orient) is a reversed substitute for suicide. Not to kill oneself (for love) means: to take this       decision, not to possess the other. It is the same moment       when Werther kills himself and when he could have renounced possessing Charlotte: it is either that or death       (hence, a Solemn moment).        2.    The will-to-possess must cease - but also the non-   will-to-possess must not be seen: no oblation. I do not       want to replace the intense throes of passion by "an impoverished life, the will-to-die, the great lassitude."       The N.W.P. is not on the side of kindness, the N.W.P. is       intense, dry: on one hand, I do not oppose myself to the       sensorial world, I let desire circulate within me; on the       other hand, I prop it up against "my truth": my truth is to       Tao       love absolutely: otherwise, I withdraw, I scatter myself,       like an army which abandons a siege.        3.       And if the N.W.P. were a tactical notion (at       last!)? If I still (though secretly) wanted to conquer the       other by feigning to renounce him? If I withdrew in order       to possess him more certainly? The reversi (that game in       which the winner takes the fewest tricks) rests on a feint       familiar to the sages ("My strength is in my weakness").    This notion is a ruse, because it takes up a position within       the very heart of passion, whose obsessions and anxieties       it leaves intact.        A final snare: renouncing any will-to-possess, I exalt and       enchant myself by the "good image" I shall present of       myself. I do not get out of the system: "Armance, exalted       ... by a certain enthusiasm of virtue which was still a       way of loving Octave... ").        4.    For the notion of N.W.P. to be able to break with       the system of the Image-repertoire, I must manage (by the       determination of what obscure exhaustion?) to let myself       drop somewhere outside of language, into the inert, and in       a sense, quite simply, to sit down ("As I sit calmly, with   out doing anything, spring comes and the grass grows of       its own accord"). And again the Orient: not to try to    possess the non-will-to-possess; to let come (from the    other) what comes, to let pass (from the other) what    goes; to possess nothing, to repel nothing: to receive, not    to keep, to produce without appropriating, etc. Or again:    "The perfect Tao offers no difficulty, except that it avoids choosing."        5.       So desire still irrigates the Non-will-to-possess    by this perilous movement: I love you is in my head,    but I imprison it behind my lips. I do not divulge. I say    silently to who is no longer or is not yet the other: I keep    myself from loving you.           Nietzschean accent: "Not to pray any longer - to bless!"    Mystical accent: The best and most delectable wine, and    also the most intoxicating... by which, without drinking it, the annihilated soul is intoxicated, a soul at once    free and intoxicated! forgetting, forgotten, intoxicated by    what it does not drink and will never drink!"
